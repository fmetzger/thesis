\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Hlavacs for his advice and especially for taking over the supervision of my thesis at such a late stage on short notice. I would like to extend my thanks to my reviewers Professor Reichl as well as Professor Tran-Gia for accepting my review request and supporting me during the thesis process.

A big thanks also goes to my colleagues, former colleagues, as well as student helpers including Albert Rafetseder, David Stezenbach, Lukas Pühringer, Christoph Steindl, Katharina Salzlechner, Ákos Lukovics, Christian Schwartz, and Steffen Gebert for their general support, for their work on many big and small tasks, and last but not least for the educational and simultaneously entertaining discussions.
