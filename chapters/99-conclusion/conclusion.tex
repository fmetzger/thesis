Reliable streaming deviates from the established ways in a number of significant ways. In the past, streaming was dominated by server-controlled push-based approaches.

Again make the Internet stack vs. mobile stack comparison

mention scalability issues of control plane in general and that there is no actual need for this

compare on basis of core networking principles: KISS, E2E, layering/encapsulation,
