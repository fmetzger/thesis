%% new thesis stuff
Packet Switching, the process of chunking information into smaller bits, labeling it and transmitting it independently, was first described by Paul Baran in the 1960s\cite{baran1964distributed}. This changed communication a lot and provided one of the foundations for the emergence of the Internet. 

The original usage intent was mostly limited to remotely logging into and communicating with mainframe computers and transferring files supported by the emergence of new multiuser and multitasking operating systems, especially including the release of UNIX in 1969.\todo{needs references}

From these early times countless other services and applications emerged. Today, the Internet is by used hundreds of millions of people, touching almost every aspect of daily life. The creation of the World Wide Web -- begun by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989\todo{reference} -- brought an easily accessible ``user interface'' to the Internet and made adoption for the masses much easier. Today, almost any form of application is available through the Web as a combination of \ac{HTML}, \ac{CSS}, and JavaScript and can be accessed by just opening a Web browser.

But as is the case with many technological fields, the Internet's development was also closely entangled with other advancements. Take the huge Internet music wave beginning in 1999 as an example. It may have been started by the creation of Napster, the first peer-to-peer file sharing service. However, without the large improvements in audio compression -- namely MP3 -- a few years before, including computers that could handle decompression as well as compression and increasing Internet access bandwidth (and fixed service fees) , this would not have been possible. Similarly, YouTube could not have existed without a wide spread of digital camcorders and many other devices with recording capability, good video compression codes, and an even further increase in access bandwidths.
 For every leap in bandwidth new services sprung to life fueling the users' demand for further capacity increases. 

% content agnosticism: we do not know what applications the future will bring, so we do not make any assumptions

Several factors contributed to the quick acceptance of the Internet. First and foremost no assumptions are made on the transported content, or content agnosticism. The original idea is to treat every packet, every participating node the same and do not make any assumptions on specific applications. This provides a level playing field for every contender wanting to offer services. This is upheld by the second driving concept, the ``End-to-End Principle'', \cite{saltzer1984end2end} stating:

\begin{quote}
``The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communications system. Therefore, providing that questioned function as a feature of the communication system itself is not possible. [...]''
\end{quote}

End-to-End means that any functionality, meaning services or applications, should only be implemented at the two endpoints of a transmission not somewhere in between. Tuning the network to specific applications and implementing functions inside the network, will always only be valid for existing and narrow use cases and cannot support future developments.

During the past decades this has often been discussed  \cite{bhattacharjee1997active, blumenthal2001rethinking, isenberg1997rise, lemley2000end} but is still being upheld for the most part for good reason. \todo{probably should clarify the good reason}. This is in contrast to the way telephone networks and their operating companies historically worked. These networks, are based on circuit switching and access as well as content (namely voice calls) and procedures are tightly controlled by the operator.

\end{figure}

The total volume of Internet traffic has been rising exponentially for many years. The composition of today's traffic is manifold, but one of the largest contributing factors is arguably video (take a look at Figures~\ref{c1:fig:traffic_netvine} and \ref{c1:fig:traffic_cisco}). Studies predicting the development of the Internet's traffic also tell of the large influence of video in the near future. The two main sources for this video are YouTube\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com}} and, in countries where its available, Netflix\footnote{\url{https://www.netflix.com}}

Despite not wanting to tune the network to video, it is still very important to understand the dynamics happening around this type of traffic there. With a traffic portion this large any events or behavior specific to this portion will also have a huge impact on the total network.
Transporting this video in the Internet has again become a topic of hot discussions. There are long-standing application layer protocols for exactly this use case. \ac{RTP}, as the most prominent, has been described as early as 1996 \cite{rfc1889}. It is well described in standard educational literature and specifics to it are still being improved and researched on. However,

Long-standing and well researched transport modes, e.g. \ac{RTP}, are challenged by new ones, which integrate themselves better into the current web ecosystem. Yet, they use completely different approaches to streaming and the control thereof. This is also the first research interest of the doctoral thesis.
Streaming, or more generalized media transport is also not only relevant for the purpose of watching videos, there are many more fields of use which have slightly different requirements. With the popular cloud computing approach, which essentially means to run ones applications remotely on any number of hosts, it is necessary to transport the output of the applications, which often can be graphical, to the client. This is especially true for so-called Cloud Gaming services, which have hard temporal constraints on both directions of the transport path.

 And there is still a lot of room to improve.

Mobile networks are still much closer to their circuit switching roots. Having evolved from GSM over UMTS to LTE, mobile networks have only very recently become fully packet switched. However, the data transport through its many core network elements is still using connection oriented techniques. The radio access' properties are also wildly different to traditional This poses unique challenges and opportunities for the design and performance of protocols. Therefore, we take a special interest in mobile network environments in our research of video streaming.

Concepts for future Internet structures are strongly disputed at the moment. A vast array of concepts is under discussion to either replace or enhance the protocol stack of the Internet's current setup. It will be interesting to measure the influence on media streaming and transport of these proposed changes or if there is any influence at all.

A similar development for cellular networks is now ongoing. Through the advent of affordable high performance smartphones and access technologies like UMTS and LTE many are now using their phones as the primary device for interacting with the Internet, including video streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix, or Hulu.





This can put pressure on the overly complex cellular network structures. The radio transmissions have only access to a limited radio frequency spectrum that, moreover, has to be shared with any other phone user in the same cell. But there is also deemed to be significant pressure on the traffic management mechanisms of the mobile core networks backing up and aggregating the numerous radio cells of an operator. Little is known of the exact make-up of these networks as they are closely guarded secrets of the operator.

The popularity of these video services can to a degree be attributed to their full integration into the WWW. While previous offerings used completely different techniques which required the use of additional software, today one can enjoy videos just by directing ones browser to a website. Furthermore, other services related to video streaming are now also beginning to migrate to Web platforms. An example that is becoming increasingly popular at the moment are cloud gaming offerings which uses mechanisms very similar to real time video streaming but has stringent temporal constraints.


Most of today's services base itself on the Web and HTTP as ``transport protocol''. It is even proposed to use
a slightly modified version of HTTP as the basic end-to-end protocol for a future iteration of the Internet\cite{Popa:2010:HNW:1868447.1868453} as it already fulfills many of the demands proposed for the future of the Internet.


There are other applications closely related to video streaming and are showing similar transmission characteristics. Examples include remote desktop services or cloud gaming. Cloud gaming facilitates the same core principles as video streaming. However, it adds strong bidirectional real time requirements as user interaction needs to be immediately reflected in the streamed images. One of the concerns of the thesis could be an investigation of streaming models for cloud gaming in the context of mechanisms used . Initial work has already been done, e.g., in \cite{4795441,wang2009modeling,jarschel2011cloudevaluation,ct2010wolken}.

\section{Motifs}




\subsection{Technical Solution Spaces}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/hv-topics-new.pdf}
    \caption{Technical solution spaces to the problem layers.}
    \label{c1:fig:hv-topics}
\end{figure}

As discussed, the core problems are layered into services and transport. Technologically, to solve the tasks of video streaming, one can approach these  threefold as displayed in Fig. \ref{c1:fig:hv-topics}.

The first is to dissect the involved protocols and architectures and break them down into their functional and methodical components. This will result in an improved understanding on the manner and process of their implementation. These components serve as building blocks for generalized models that abstracts the problem space from the actual implementation. The model will be defined by a set of parameters. To explore viable parameter ranges performance evaluation methods will be facilitated.


Secondly, using performance evaluation a system is methodically tested to the outcome of determining the influence of the system's parameters on a set of performance metrics. The parameters can be categorized into system intrinsic parameters, describing behavior only relevant and observable inside the system, and external parameters. In communication networks a good example for external parameters are the network Quality of Service parameters including latency, loss, jitter, and bandwidth capacity. Identifying fitting metrics for the measurement is a challenge. They can be either subjective or objective. The former are called Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. They can only be measured by conducting empirical user studies and questionnaires and are mapped to a Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Extensive work has already been done to define baseline references for QoE metrics. Using these, one can directly translate objectively measurable outcomes into QoE metrics. However, these mappings may need to be adjusted to be able to handle stalling as the main source of quality loss. Examples for measuring subjective quality are available in \cite{gustafsson2008measuring, ketyo2010qoe}. 
Finally, one could employ methods of self-organization to try to reach improvements over conventional network setups.


\subsection{Apparatus for System Analyses and Comparison}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/apparatus-new.pdf}
    \caption{Methodical solution spaces and apparatus comparison.}
    \label{c1:fig:appcomp}
\end{figure}

Depicted in Figure \ref{c1:fig:appcomp} are levels of abstraction involved in system analysis and possible approaches to understand the system involved.

The upper limit for precision is achieved through actual measurements of the system itself. These give a point of reference and can be used to validate all other methods. However, this is not feasible to ascertain a larger view. The time frame or the physical size of the system is always limited.

Aside from measurements on implementations there are three further possible approaches which can widen the scope: emulation, simulation and mathematical analysis. 
Emulation tries to resemble implemented functionality as closely as possible while reducing the non-important parts to a minimum. Measurements using emulations can run in a normal network environment testbed and thus can only be done on a scale equivalent to implementations. The simulative approach implements all internal and external functionality, including the physical nodes and the network, in a discrete event simulation (DES). There may be subtle functional differences between a simulation and a real implementation. Therefore, validation is required. This approach benefits from the decoupling of the simulation from physical nodes as well as real time, allowing to measure large-scale networks in a short amount of time.
A mathematical analysis, for example using queuing theory and stochastic models, can then further broaden the understanding of the system.


The methods can all be used to define and explore solution spaces and are therefore important tools in understanding the problem. A fitting combination of these tools has to be found to advance the research. Our initial approach is to investigate existing streaming services, YouTube \cite{metzger2011delivery,mok2011measuring} and,e.g., video libraries of broadcast stations for simple HTTP streaming. A suitable candidate for measuring adaptive streaming still needs to be found as some candidate services apply regional restrictions. There are several reference applications available that implement different standardization approaches. These can be used to either directly measure the performance or to setup an emulation model based on their specifications.


\subsection{Further Approaches}
Further approaches which are under consideration, but will not be presented in detail here, are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Application of analytic and stochastic methods.
\item Formal definition of protocols or systems using Finite State Machines (FSM).
\item Creation of equivalent models.
\item Application of queuing theory, modeling the system through arrival processes, service time distributions and a number of servers and waiting places.
\item Data-mining of network trace data from mobile networks.

\section{Goals and Aims}

The topic of the thesis will be the research of the inner workings of these new streaming services and mechanisms and especially its impact on the aforementioned cellular core network structures. This means conducting performance evaluations of the streaming mechanisms on itself and in the context of mobile networks as well as performing systematic assessments and classifications of the mechanisms. 

The result will be an understanding of the quantitative attributes related to these new forms of streaming. Furthermore, the thesis should provide tools and methods that help decide all participants of media streaming and mobile network operators which protocols and methods to choose and which are best suited for specific applications
