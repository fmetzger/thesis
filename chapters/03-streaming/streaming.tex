The Web wouldn't have seen that big an increase in popularity and traffic if it weren't for the tight integration of video streaming into every browser. Most forms of today's Web-based video delivery take advantage of \gls{HTTP} and \gls{TCP} to transport video. This is a completely different approach to what was used before and is traditionally understood as video streaming. 
Streaming itself can be conducted in many ways, resulting in an ever-increasing number of protocols. Furthermore, the current boom in smartphones creates an increasing plurality of access network technologies.
Any network shows characteristic properties, or \gls{QoS} metrics. These are typically:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{bandwidth}, or the maximum throughput a user can achieve, which is always limited by at least one link, serving as the bottleneck. In most cases this will be the access link, but can also be any other link in times of high load. Bandwidth on an access medium can also be shared between all of its participants as is the case with any radio technology or cable Internet access.
\item The \textit{delay} is the time data travels between a sender and a recipient. The term \textit{jitter} is used  for the delay variation and occurs for example when successive packets travel on different routes or through different radio receivers during mobility.
\item \textit{Loss} occurs when data packets do not reach the target. An imperfect physical medium can flip some bits in a packet, which the responsible protocol layer will recognize and drop the packet or re-request it.
\end{itemize}

Video streaming needs to cope with all of these circumstances and still work well. This chapter investigates the model Web streaming uses. It differs significantly from models for traditional streaming, which are mostly specific to a single protocol.
The presented method rather aims to evaluate the performance by capturing generic behavioral patterns of streaming mechanisms from the perspective of a streaming application. Specifically, the model is based on the level of the playback buffer, which is a common attribute to any media playback.
Thus, it can consider any network and playback behavior, and maintains flexibility with regards to the actual streaming server implementation, type of transmission network, protocol stack, and codec.

After defining an appropriate performance metric, this model is implemented in a network emulation testbed. A measurement campaign on YouTube is then conducted while the network is being subjected to emulated \gls{QoS} parameters (compare also our with publications \cite{metzger2011delivery} and \cite{6229739}).

\section{Streaming Summary}
\label{c3:conclusion}

take a look back at the overall picture: measuring and modeling streaming and mobile networks

% merge into chapter summary
Through these to exemplary experiments, we tried to show that network QoS parameters have a direct measurable impact on the application layer, namely on HTTP streaming quality. While the models scale rather well with latency, any HTTP streaming is almost impossible with high packet loss values.Comparing the presented playback models, we conclude that every model represents a trade-off between several parameters, e.g. as measured here, the number and length of stalls. With the knowledge gained from the experiments, playback models could be tailor-made to best suit certain conditions and user requirements.

Streaming to mobile devices, especially in mobility scenarios, arises several new issues not seen at wireline connected devices. The lower-layer protocols on the radio link can cause additional unexpected behavior. Handover between radio cells can cause long periods of very high delay (up to seconds) and packet reordering which does not play well with TCP, resulting in a decreased throughput. Therefore, we would like to investigate its interplay with server-side bandwidth pacing methods as employed by YouTube.

We also would like to extend our analysis of video streaming to adaptive HTTP streaming mechanisms previously mentioned. We expect them to further complicate the client's buffer management algorithms but they could also serve as a full replacement and evolution to RTP streaming.

In our research we analyzed both the topology as well as the streaming performance of the YouTube platform as a popular example for today's Web-based video delivery. 

With the Seattle platform we actively probed the CDN and discovered several geographical and time-dependent features. Through streaming experiments we have shown that packet loss and delay have considerable influence on the quality of the HTTP video delivery but overall it is reasonably robust to conditions in normal wireline networks. Whether they work as well in wireless networks is a question for future research. Furthermore, we looked at various theoretical and real-world buffering models. We observed that one needs to strike a balance between frequency and length of buffering phases to achieve acceptable playback quality. However, quantizing the quality is also a topic for further research.

%% PV Conclusion
Because of rapid developments in the field of video streaming, full-scale measurement campaigns and analytical modeling might prove too time consuming to test every new protocol. The streaming model framework presented here offers methodologies to quickly evaluate new streaming mechanisms under the influence of network QoS as it decouples the network trace recording and the playback model calculation phase.

We detailed possible influences of the different network layers on video streaming, This inspired the creation of a generic model, incorporating universal notions on data transport, flow control, and buffering, striving to cover most possible streaming methods. Using this model, we explored the theoretical quality limits for streaming such as limits for the maximum stalling duration, and the user trade-offs incurred by making specific choices on how to treat conditions related to streaming processes. In our evaluation of the model on YouTube we observed the influence of network QoS on playback quality and found that high loss is detrimental to HTTP streaming.

The purpose of this model and its evaluations is manifold. It could lead to protocols tailor-made for specific networks or an improved network planning process.
