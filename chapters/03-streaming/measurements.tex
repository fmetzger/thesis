\section{Measurements}
\label{c3:measurements}

With these playback models at hand, this section demonstrates how to conduct actual evaluations of reliable streaming protocols with it.

As discussed, there are numerous incarnations of reliable streaming protocols in use. Almost all of them follow the same basic approach but with slight variations in execution and choice of playback strategies and corresponding parameters. But it is exactly these choices that can have a large impact on the streaming process and resulting quality. 

The problem lies in comparing these protocols to each other. Each of them is usually tied to a specific -- and most often proprietary closed source -- streaming player. Setting up all these players in one testbed is a huge effort and requires very specific software environments to be used on the client machines. Moreover, these players are built with user interaction and not automation and directly measuring the outcome in mind. This can still be achieved through extensive workarounds, but must be tailored to every player application. The presented approach avoids this hassle and provides a concise way to test any conceivable playback strategy in one single testbed.

Testbed Architecture



Testing and comparing new protocols is a complex and time-consuming undertaking if traditional evaluation approaches such as analytical source-traffic models are employed. For today's fast-paced development of streaming protocols, faster evaluation methods are needed. A testing environment must be simple and sufficiently flexible to allow its application on and adaption to current and future protocols, services, network structures, and associated parameter spaces. 
% This also demands to take a generic approach that does not rely on specific implementations. 
At the same time, it must be able to answer specific questions about  protocols, applications, and network setups. Finally, the results yielded from analyzing and evaluating a streaming service should be user-oriented, i.e. provide a foundation of data that can be fed into the calculation of a Quality of Experience (QoE) model. We believe our proposed testbed, the architecture of which will be explained in the following, meets these requirements.

%In the following sections, we first describe the methodology and then present exemplary evaluations to show how this approach can be used to evaluate real world streaming scenarios under configurable network conditions. 
% Through configuration, one may evaluate the influence of network parameters, states, and topologies on the multimedia stream, e.g. parallel bearers with different quality settings, cross traffic, or stream-support middleboxes.


Figure \ref{c3:fig:testbed} depicts the evaluation testbed. % To enable rapid comparison of network quality of service against application behaviors we employ a two-step process. 
Conceptually, it replicates the actual steps a user would perform to consume a media stream on a playback device. Through appropriate configuration different scenarios can be modeled, e.g. network conditions, behavior and specifics of the user device.

In the first pass of the process, the stream data is transmitted from a server to the client. The server can either be an actual streaming service on the Internet, or a local server (to eliminate the unpredictable impact of the Internet connection). The traffic is directed through a network emulation node capable of altering the network QoS parameters, i.e. latency, jitter, and packet loss. The parameters could also be set according to stochastic models derived from actual network traces. 
%Therefore, almost any kind of access network conditions can be modeled. 
%Of particular interest are mobile radio behaviors and core network architectures. An example would be to compare guaranteed bit rate (GBR) with best-effort PDP contexts to assess the impact of QoS parameters on the stream quality.

The measurement host downloads and records the video stream as a network trace. For HTTP streaming, it issues a single HTTP \texttt{GET} request on the video file, and then maintains the TCP connection until the file has fully arrived. A trace should at least contain the sizes and timestamps of every incoming packet. More detailed traces can be used to scrutinize other layers of the connection, e.g. the dynamics of TCP receive window size. The packet trace is then decoded using the popular open source \texttt{ffmpeg} suite, yielding another set of traces consisting of video frame sizes and playout timestamps.

In the second pass, these two traces are then used to feed the playback models described before. The playback emulation process combines the transmission and video frame traces to calculate the playback buffer fill level for every point in time during the playback. It then generates statistics about user-perceivable artifacts such as playback stalls that would occur during the playback. These statistics can then be compared to the results of other models and network QoS.

% For simple HTTP streaming, there is no feedback from the client to the server that would result in adaptions of the stream (``rate control''). Therefore, recording the packet trace and simulating playback are decoupled, as the latter cannot influence the former. As such, the testbed can test and compare several playback models on the same recorded network trace. This enables fast and efficient comparison of non-feedback protocols subject to the same network conditions.



For the YouTube streaming measurements we implemented an automated video downloading and playback simulation software to feed information into the model and evaluate the total stalling time. For this the simple stalling model is used because this results in the shortest possible playback duration in every scenario. Furthermore, we used a network emulation testbed to subject the video streaming to increased loss and latency while fixing the maximum network bandwidth and observe the influence on the QoE.

%Also observed and analyzed. The deduce that the initial buffering time and the later block sending rate are directly correlated. 64kb blocks, probably due to GFS, problems with this method, ...
%These Quality-of-Service parameters loss and delay do not have any direct influence on the downloading process but instead have negative impacts on the throughput of the underlying TCP due to its congestion control feature and, in the end, serve as another source of delay and jitter.

First use case to show how our system works: Progressive HTTP streaming. Will show adaptability to adaptive streaming and different protocols. For this comparison we used a video of about 90 seconds length and network conditions that could not fulfill the video bitrate in time and hereby forced stalling to occur.

We performed two measurement series, one with increased packet loss, the other one adding latency to the path. For each value of loss and latency a mean total stalling time was calculated out of five separate experiments to eliminate temporal and network load influences. Additionally, standard deviations are shown in the resulting graphs. We clearly notice very large deviations in some experiments. Some of these can be explained by connection timeouts and later resumption of the streaming. Furthermore, an exponential regression line shows the trend of the total stalling times in the experiments.

Figure \ref{c3:fig:delayseries} displays the results of of the latency measurement series with up to five seconds of additional delay. In the worst case the stalling time increases to about 50 seconds. In mobile scenarios latencies of up to 2 seconds can be expected, which would, according to our measurements, result in a maximum mean stalling time of 15 seconds for a 90 second video, which could very well be bearable for YouTube users.

There are several factors that could contribute to the increase in stalling time in the latency experiments. 
TCP, in its simplest form, increases the congestion window based on the Round Trip Time (RTT), making it highly dependent on this connection parameter. Newer congestion avoidance algorithms, e.g. the CUBIC algorithm used in Linux \cite{ha2008cubic}, however reduce this dependence on the RTT.
Another influencing factor might be YouTube's block sending mechanism, which, according to \cite{alcock2011afcyt}, may negatively interact with congestion control algorithms. The impact of packet loss on stalling is much higher than that of latency in our measurements. Yet, due to TCP's reliable transmissions, loss only causes increased packet retransmissions, and, thus, acts as a source of burst delay which negatively impacts the overall throughput.

Figure \ref{c3:fig:lossseries} shows the series of loss experiments. While the 6\% packet loss and below has an almost negligible influence on the stalling time anything above this value will probably not achieve good user experience at all. Interesting to note is the rather sudden increase in stalling time when there is more than 6\% loss added. This could again hints to the transport protocol's reliable transport feature, which catches all the occurring losses, through timeouts or gaps in the sequence numbers. However, the detection and retransmission takes some time, which is reflected in the increased stalling time.



The results presented here show some of the capabilities in comparing play network conditions based on playback models. We compare how the four playback models introduced previously fare against each other in a measurement series featuring  emulated transmission latency and packet loss . At the same time, we acknowledge that other specific questions are not touched in this first set of experiments, e.g. the inclusion of a mobile network or handset, or RTP-based streams.

The video used in our measurements was streamed from the YouTube web site. This provides a realistic base for all the experiments. Note that YouTube also employs its own form of application layer flow control in addition to TCP's \cite{alcock2011afcyt}. % The influence of the access bandwidth can mostly be neglected with this mechanism as long as the limit is well above the video bitrate, which was the case here.
Details on the streamed video are available in Table \ref{c3:tbl:videoparams}.

For the loss experiment series, the network emulator was configured to drop a certain percentage of packets based on a normal distribution on both the uplink and the downlink direction. There was no loss correlation involved, the existence of which one would expect, e.g., in wireless networks. One streaming run for every two percentage points of additional loss up to 14\% was conducted.
In the latency series, the emulator delayed the delivery of every packet for a set constant amount of time. Half of the total amount is added to the uplink the other half to the downlink. One experiment was conducted for every 100ms of additional delay, up to a total of 5000ms.

After the traces were recorded, every playback model was applied to all runs. For every model, two data points were computed. First, the total stalling time was calculated. This is the time the player keeps buffering and not playing the video, including the initial start delay. To attain results comparable to the other measurements, the stalling time is calculated relative to the total video length instead of an absolute value. The second resulting value is the number of times the video stops playing including the initial delay, i.e. the stalling frequency. Both of them are an indicator how well the playback mechanism can cope with the currently emulated network setup. They could for example be used to either check if a modification to a network has a noticeable impact on streaming experience, or to find an optimized player behavior for a given network.

All models will generally work very similar in good network conditions. If sufficient bandwidth is available, they will play videos with almost no delay and  intermediate buffering. If, however, the achievable TCP goodput is close to the average video bitrate, the buffer may be strained by short deviations from the average rates. %TCP goodput can also be severely limited by high latency and loss. Many TCP congestion control algorithms depend on the round trip time. If the RTT is high, the congestion window will increase much slower.

High latency can also trigger TCP timeouts and retransmissions, and in turn decrease the congestion window, further impacting the goodput. The latency measurements are depicted in Figures \ref{c3:fig:eval-latency-stallingtime} and \ref{c3:fig:eval-latency-numstalls}. The stalling time increases with the additional latency. The Initial Start Delay model provides the best possible result in terms of pure stalling time. On the other hand, Figure \ref{c3:fig:eval-latency-numstalls} shows the Stalling model provides always the worst result for the number of stalls. Any other model will lie beyond that line. The Flash and HTML5 models both run in just a few buffering events which however tend to increase in length with rising latency. Attributed to the simple and optimistic assumption of the Flash model, stalling time is usually lower than with HTML5, at the cost of slightly more buffering events.

TCP goodput is even more severely affected by packet loss. A lost packet results in a duplicate acknowledgement, retransmissions, and a decrease of the congestion window. The problem gets worse if also the ACKs are lost and the connection stalls on missing old segments without which the playback cannot proceed. Figure xyz shows some exemplary measurements for a loss scenario. While additional packet losses of up to four percent seem to have no noticeable impact on streaming quality, the total stalling time suffers a large increase for any model as seen in Fig. \ref{c3:fig:eval-loss-stallingtime} rendering any streaming attempts practically unusable. Figure \ref{c3:fig:eval-loss-numstalls} shows the extremity of the Stalling model compared to other models reaching a number orders of magnitude larger than any other model.
As a result, when planning a network for streaming applications, the maximum loss should be kept below the noticed mark to achieve reasonable streaming quality.

Through these to exemplary experiments, we tried to show that network QoS parameters have a direct measurable impact on the application layer, namely on HTTP streaming quality. While the models scale rather well with latency, any HTTP streaming is almost impossible with high packet loss values.
Comparing the presented playback models, we conclude that every model represents a trade-off between several parameters, e.g. as measured here, the number and length of stalls. With the knowledge gained from the experiments, playback models could be tailor-made to best suit certain conditions and user requirements.
