\subsection{Services in the Internet}

\subsubsection{Video Streaming}

\subsection{Streaming and Other Transmission Approaches}
History, correlation to external developments (codecs, access bandwidths), techniques

observe existing systems, e.g. YouTube \cite{metzger2011delivery}

\subsubsection{Mechanisms}
RTP, HTTP, adaptivity and reliability, application layer flow control, push and pull, fairness, segmentation
\subsubsection{Quality Estimation and Modeling}
QoE metrics, MOS, stalling time and buffering models, subjective and objective testing


Cloud gaming as a media streaming application with strong real-time requirements \cite{4795441,wang2009modeling,jarschel2011cloudevaluation,ct2010wolken}



\subsection{Current and Future Transport Developments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Improvements to congestion control for mobile streaming
\item Alternative modes of transport (e.g. DCCP, ECN, ReECN, RED, Google's SPDY or new approaches)
\item Influence of L1/2/3 layer protocols and mechanisms (IPv4/6, tunneling, ethernet vs RLC/RRC/NAS, ...) %; what works better with it? compare, model and measure

\end{itemize}


TCP modifications for short-lived connections (e.g. initially ignore congestion avoidance and push a lot of data at once (google.com approach, Increasing TCP's Initial Window))
