\section{Influence of Layers}
\label{c5:crosslayerhinting}


Wired Internet access has a very narrow choice of protocols on the \gls{ISO}/\gls{OSI} Layers 1 and 2. The typical use-case consists of a \gls{LAN} using Ethernet which is then tunneled through or translated into one of several access technologies, e.g., \gls{DSL}, \gls{DOCSIS}, or \gls{PON}. Applications often make assumptions that rely on the presence of these protocols and their specific characteristics.

However, Internet access today is similarly often achieved using mobile cellular networks. The latest standardized iteration of these is \gls{LTE} and the accompanying \gls{EPS} core network infrastructure \cite{olsson2009sae}. This is the first evolution of standards that completely removes the classical circuit switched domain making room for more radio frequency bandwidth to be used with the all-IP services achieving shared transmission capacities --- comparable to today's 802.11n WiFi --- albeit on much larger cell sizes of 1 to 30 kilometres. The \gls{EPS} network acts as an intermediary between the radio access stations and the Internet enabling strong traffic control mechanisms as well as mobility anchored at the \gls{SGW}. Traffic is routed through the core by using tunneling over the \gls{SGW} and \gls{PGW} based on the traffic bearer concept defined either in the \gls{gtp} or the \gls{PMIPv6} protocols. For every mobile device connected to the network there is one default and up to ten dedicated bearers carrying traffic filtered by pre-set \gls{QoS} parameters. Control is enforced through a logically separate network control plane, that is also used to setup and tear down these bearers. Figure fig:ltestack displays the disparity between the Internet's protocol stack and that of an \gls{LTE} network encapsulating all user traffic in additional protocol layers by the tunneling process.

Research work is ongoing how to best work with this complex network setup. It is expected, that with the rise of mobile access the core network comes under heavy traffic pressure with negative affects on the \gls{QoS} of best-effort traffic. Endeavors are required to study the loaded network's behavior. Also very little work has gone into exploring the control plane characteristics of these networks, including their performance. A novel approach could also be, to make mobile device applications, e.g. video streaming players, aware of the core networks capabilities and allow the request of tunnels tailored to their specific \gls{QoS} requirements resulting in a possible increase of perceived quality.

% influence of signaling plane and core network elements - scaling

The protocols used for the radio transmissions behave very differently when compared to Ethernet and assumptions made by higher layers may not hold any more. This can apply to, e.g., reliability, frame sizing and fragmenting, and latency amounting to undesired effects on higher-layer traffic. For example, loss in \gls{GSM} and \gls{UMTS} networks is often caught transparently on layer 2 and a retransmission is conducted. However, in the time the retransmission takes the transport layer may have already run into a timeout and re-requested the missing segment on its own, resulting in additional delay and a waste of bandwidth. This is especially detrimental for time-critical applications like video streaming, possibly resulting in buffer underruns and degraded quality. Transport and application layer mechanisms need to be able to understand this and cope with the effects. E.g., \gls{TCP} retransmissions and congestion control could be adjusted in the course of understanding this.

Furthermore, traffic could be avoided during cell handover occurrences. This would require cross-layer cooperation and an awareness of the application when an handover is supposed to occur. The application then could schedule its traffic accordingly. Traffic falling into a handover is subject to especially high latency and loss because the mobile network acts as a mobility anchor which needs to internally reroute incoming traffic to the mobile device's new position. \gls{HTTP} traffic is especially suited to this scheduling behavior because of its statelessness and consistence of small objects that can be requested and transferred independently.


%%
\subsection{Cross-Layer Mobility Hinting}

Today's mobile networks are all of a cellular design. A device that moves from one cell to the other has to perform a so-called handover. During this process the device is deregistered in one cell and registered in the new one. All network traffic currently in flight has to be rerouted or relayed to the device's new location. 
Although seemingly transparent to the device's application, adverse side effects can occur during a handover, including an increase and variability of latency. 

Mobility support today always means network assisted mobility. Typically, the network decides the best possible mobility strategy from its point of view and provides infrastructure to support seamless handovers in the form of mobility anchor nodes. However, the device is actually in a very unique position, as it knows a great deal more about its traffic mix, its currently running applications and its user than the network ever could and should.
Unfortunately, most of this information remains unused, as today's network infrastructures and lower layer protocol stacks provide only very slim changes to exert control over decisions regarding the device.

Nonetheless, a lot could still be done when providing the device's operating system and application ecosystem with a simple bidirectional pathway for vertical information and control flow across network protocol layers and to other low-level systems. This work aims to do just that by providing a generic interface and exchange protocol for any kind of information relevant to an application's decision making process. With this meaningful actions and reactions of individual layers can be defined and tested. Possible use cases are provided in the next section.

Still, one has also to keep in mind, that layering and encapsulation is there for a reason and violating this is a rather risky undertaking. However, we do not think that our approach actually violates these basic principles and only extends on the ways one can communicate and interact with all individual layers without changing anything in them.

\subsubsection{Scenario Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Video/Voice calls that notify the other party, that interruptions are expected to occur.

	\item Using current location data and movement patterns/predictions to improve cell selections and initiate horizontal and vertical handovers to a time suitable for the device and running applications.

	\begin{figure}[htb]
	        \centering
	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
	            \centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/adaptive-streaming-no-cl.pdf}
				\caption{Stalling occurs without handover hinting.}
				\label{c5:fig:streaming-hinting-no-cl}
	        \end{subfigure}%

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/adaptive-streaming-cl.pdf}
				\caption{Stalling can be prevented by hinting and proactively filling the playback buffer.}
				\label{c5:fig:streaming-hinting-cl}
			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mockup of handover prediction and hinting for adaptive streaming and thus avoiding playback stalls.}
	\label{c5:fig:streaming-hinting}
	\end{figure}

	\item An adaptive streaming video application increases its video buffer when a shortly upcoming handover is announced to survive the service outage. This can be achieved by an increased rate of segment retrieval and a reduction in segment quality. The goal is to avoid any possible playback stalls due to the handover. Figure~\ref{c5:fig:streaming-hinting} demonstrates this circumstance.

	\begin{figure}[htb]
	        \centering
	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
	            \centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/http-reorder-no-cl.pdf}
				\caption{The handover will block currently active object transmissions, page display will be delayed.}
				\label{c5:fig:http-reorder-no-cl}
	        \end{subfigure}%

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/http-reorder-cl.pdf}
				\caption{The browser reorders the objects to be retrieved and avoids any transmissions during the indicated handover period.}
				\label{c5:fig:http-reorder-cl}
			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mock-up of \gls{HTTP} reordering with handover awareness.}
	\label{c5:fig:http-reorder}
	\end{figure}

	\item Enable applications to adapt themselves to the conditions currently experienced by the networking stack and its sensors. For example, a Web browser could reorder its Website object requests to avoid sending any requests during handover periods and experience additional delay as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:http-reorder}.

	\item A cross-layer enabled device can also offer a wide range of policy choices to its applications or even directly to the user. An example rule could be: ``Do not handover to a stationary WiFi from 3G when moving faster than 50km/h, only to in-vehicle WiFi.'' or ``Avoid any vertical handover, which would interrupt my service for a long time, while this VoIP call is running.''

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Implementation}

The Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Userspace daemon that collects information from kernelspace protocol implementations and sensors and provides them to all applications.
	\item shared bus control/information system, instead of explicit comm; signaling only to interested parties
	\item provide common interface also to all available sensors and layer 1 and 2 network information and control (similar to Android)
	\item IPC message bus, possibly D-Bus\footnote{\url{http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/}} based
	\item Could extend NetworkManager\footnote{\url{https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager}}, some functionality is already provided there

\end{itemize}

The process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tell Transport/Application the expected time till handover / time of uninterrupted service
\item Tell Transport/App expected connection parameters (latency, BW, ...)
\item Application selects \gls{DASH} stream appropriate to parameters
\item Application reorders \gls{HTTP} GETs so that large GETs are not interrupted
\item Application stops transfers when handover is about to occur
\item Layer 1/2 gives a list of possible handovers to Application
\item Application selects (better: suggests) handover which fits best and reorders accordingly
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Planned Work and Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
	\item investigate how much information is exposed and what can already be done
	\item Analysis of data traces and realistic simulations in order to capture in detail the unwanted phenomena
	\item Verify the suitability of the State-of-the-Art algorithms and protocols which address this problem

\subsection{Mobile Measurements with Additional Metadata}
\label{c5:sensorium}

SENSORIUM EXCURSION
CONTEXT: (active) measurements in mobile networks should make use of the device's current state and environment. i.e., read its sensor data and put measurements in context with it. Alternatively, use anonymized sensor data for new kinds of evaluations (can this device watch video at all at the current location?)
CONTEXT

Modern computing devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablet computers are equipped with an increasing number of sensors: \gls{GPS}, tilt, and acceleration meters quantify the physical position and orientation of the device; 3G, WiFi, and other  interfaces gather data on the availability and signal quality of wireless networks; temperature and ambient light sensors deliver additional insight into a user's work and home environments.

There exist problems for the practical viability of collection data though: Different devices and platforms such as Android and iOS use very different interfaces into their sensors; privacy is another issue hardly tackled on any platform other than in a crude binary (allow/deny access) way. Therefore, in this demo we introduce Sensorium, a generic sensor reading framework that funnels data from actual sensor drivers, implements fine-grained privacy control for the user, and provides generic outbound interfaces such as \acrshort{XML}-\acrshort{RPC}. We also show an application using it, O3GM, which visualizes mobile coverage data coming from Sensorium.

%Sensor interfaces differ -> difficult to do generic stuff with them
Sensorium can access all the information a device provides and makes them available to other applications. Up until now, it has been a challenging task for software developers (especially scientists and experimenters) to implement specialized sensor applications. This task is simplified by providing a generic framework for interfacing sensors. In our current implementation, available for Android, most of the typical sensors are already implemented. Since giving access to sensor data also exposes the user's privacy, the user can disable or set privacy levels for each sensor individually, and all sensor readings that would be shared are displayed. %Setting higher privacy levels reduces the amount of data a sensor shares. %E.g., location data accuracy could be rounded, or just hashes of data shared.
\\

O3GM\footnote{\url{http://homepage.univie.ac.at/albert.rafetseder/o3gm}} showcases the sensors framework. It comprises a web service displaying cellular access technology data points at their \gls{GPS} locations collected by devices running Sensorium (see Figure~\ref{c5:fig:ogggm}). This solves a real-world problem: Currently, this kind of data is only available to mobile operators, which however  are hindered by commercial interests to make them publicly available --- at least in raw, unadorned form. Other projects such as OpenSignalMaps\footnote{\url{http://opensignal.com/}} and Sensorly\footnote{\url{http://www.sensorly.com/}}, as well as corporations like Google and Apple collect these data, but are very restrictive regarding usage by other parties. This is not true for O3GM:\@ We make the data points collected available as Open Data under an open content license.

Obviously, other applications are possible. Since code and data are open-sourced, everyone can implement their great ideas, port Sensorium to other platforms or reimplement our interface there, etc.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/map-cells.png}
\caption{The O3GM web page, displaying 3G coverage measurements extracted from Sensorium on top of OpenStreetMap.}
\label{c5:fig:ogggm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Architecture}

Figure~\ref{c5:fig:architecture} overviews Sensorium's architecture components, and its interplay with the data collecting parts of O3GM. \textit{Sensor drivers} are implemented on top of the operating system taking care of reading sensor values from platform-specific interfaces and pushing them upwards into the \textit{registry}. Here, sensor data is timestamped and collected. On one side, data are prepared for local display, e.g. in a \gls{GUI} or status widget. On the other side, a user-configurable \textit{privacy layer} might allow for full sensor access from above or reduce the precision of values (e.g. round \gls{GPS} coordinates); it could salt and hash sensor values for improved privacy, or completely deny access to individual (or all) sensors. Finally, other applications running on the same device are free to connect to Sensorium's \textit{outbound interfaces} to register for sensor updates or poll data. Access from sources other than localhost is not allowed for obvious privacy reasons.

Due to the layered architecture, it is very simple for contributors to add their own implementations of layers or swap them out for their own altogether. Consider a scenario when a contributor wishes to include a sensor we do not yet provide a driver for. All that needs to be implemented is code interfacing the actual sensor, and the lightweight API into our sensor registry. Similarly, additional local display methods, privacy enhancements, and outbound interfaces might be implemented.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/sensorium-arch.pdf}
\caption{Sensorium architecture with O3GM \textit{pickup}~and \textit{server}. Components described in this paper are shown dark gray.}
\label{c5:fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

Our current implementation of Sensorium\footnote{\url{https://github.com/fmetzger/android-sensorium}} runs on the Android platform. To provide a unified interface for accessing the sensor data we incorporated an \acrshort{XML}-\acrshort{RPC} library\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/android-xmlrpc/}} that listens for connections on localhost, meaning that only applications running on the same device can access it. The pickup code\footnote{\url{https://homepage.univie.ac.at/albert.rafetseder/o3gm_pickup.repy}} to collect sensor values runs on top of the renowned Seattle\footnote{\url{https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/}} platform, which is also available for Android, and allows us to remotely and securely access the collected data, and easily experiment with energy and cost efficient data upload/download strategies. The example application we implemented to make use of Sensorium, O3GM\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lukpueh/Open3GMap}}, is based on JavaScript and the OpenLayers\footnote{\url{http://openlayers.org/}} library. All of our code is dual-licensed under \gls{GPLv3} and the \acrshort{BSD} license.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/sesescreenshot.png}
\caption{Sensorium screenshot.}
\label{c5:fig:screenshot}
\end{figure}

Sensorium consists of a base registry service with a common interface which each sensor implementation can easily be plugged into. All values are also displayed for the user as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:screenshot}. The privacy layer automatically anonymizes all gathered values before making them available through XML-RPC in accordance with the user's current privacy settings.

We currently provide sensor implementations for generic device information, e.g. device name and battery status; mobile radio data such as current access technology and cell information; location data provided by the mobile network and \gls{GPS}; and  WiFi and Bluetooth information, including recent scan results.

Sensorium attempts to bring the sensing capabilities of current generation devices to a broader range of developers and experimenters. Directly using Sensorium, which is freely available from the Google Play store, or adopting the available source code gives everyone the chance to build projects like the mobile coverage Web service we presented.

\subsection{Measurement Approaches}
\label{c5:mobilestreamingtestbed}

Different Approaches

\subsubsection{Simulating Streaming Traffic Characteristics in ns-3}

TODO: Implement a HTTP Streaming Traffic Generator ns-3 Application and a streaming receiver client application.
TODO: Use LENA to transport streams
TODO: Use Python
TODO: Maybe base it on http://code.google.com/p/tmix-ns3/ ?
TODO: Maybe use ON-OFF traffic generator with streaming specific patterns; cf. to http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.17/doxygen/classns3\_1\_1\_on\_off\_application.html\#details


\subsubsection{Mobile Streaming Simulation/Emulation Hybrid Test Platform}

Use introduced streaming evaluation approaches in a mobile network environment

But do not want to use real network, as conditions are hard to manage and reproduce. Additionally, LTE still hard to come by.

Therefore, use an emulated network provided by the ns-3 network simulator. But transmit real traffic through it, i.e. use it as an emulator and bridges. \ref{fig:lte-testbed}
