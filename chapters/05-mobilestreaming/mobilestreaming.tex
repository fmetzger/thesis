\chapter{Streaming and Measuring Streaming in Mobile Networks}
\label{chap:mobilestreaming}

But what about the very probable case of not having access to mobile core network measurements? What can still be done? And what's with reliable video streaming in mobile networks, how can I investigate this?

Well, there is still the possibility of conducting active network measurements at the end-to-end paths. This limits the amount of details one can deduce from influence sources inside the network. But it also opens up a wide range of other device-based information sources, some of which are crucial in mobile devices, especially regarding mobility.

Measuring especially in hindsight of newer (and arbitrary) mobile network architectures. Fixating on one particular may harm the process.

This chapter attempts to give an overview of several mobile device-based measuring techniques, tailored to investigate both mobile networks as well as reliable video streaming simultaneously. Additionally, a broad spectrum of influence factors and properties which could improve video streaming on mobile devices, are presented and discussed.

The contributions of this chapter are two-fold. First
