\section{Recent Developments in the Mobile Network Stack}
\label{c5:sec:stack-enhancements}


Contrary to the popular scientific belief, that the Internet is unable to change and renew itself (so called Internet ``ossification'', compare, e.g., \cite{feldmann2010ossification}), protocols in the \gls{TCP}/\gls{IP} stack change all the time. Changes are more likely to occur in the end-to-end stack behavior and not in the packet format, as they are more difficult to change. New application requirements and changing network architectures always trigger adaptations in the stack in-between. 

This section briefly covers the existing protocol stacks in relation to mobile networks and streaming, new protocols and how they might influence the stack, and also discusses \gls{TCP} more closely as an example. Beneficial interactions between the stack's layers are presented in a final part.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Influences of the Existing Stack}

Superficially not much has changed in the Web's protocol stack. There is still \gls{IP}, \gls{TCP}, and \gls{HTTP} forming effectively the same protocol stack since 1991 with HTTP/0.9. And this seems hard to change, especially the transport layer is fixed to \gls{UDP} and \gls{TCP}, everything else will probably get rejected, altered or even dropped by one of the numerous middleboxes, such as \glspl{NAT}, or forced ``traffic optimization'' transparent proxies, all of which are especially prevalent in mobile networks \cite{sigcomm11middleboxes}. As a side note, this adds another layer of state kept in the network. A fact that was already discussed as being highly problematic and capable of inducing load in the core network in Chapter~\ref{chap:mobilenets}.

Each protocol, representing a layer in the stack, characteristically contributes to influencing data transmissions and varies in its degree of impact on the network as well as the intended goal of the transmission (e.g., streaming and watching a video).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/layer-timescales.pdf}
	\caption{Approximate discernible time scales the networking stack protocols operate on in each layer.}
\label{c5:fig:timescales}
\end{figure}

Associated with each layer, and with the actual application running on top of the stack as well, are different timing constraints or time constants of control. Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales} overviews the approximate time scales on which activities take place, spanning a remarkable range of twelve orders of magnitude. Complexity is introduced by stacking multiple layers on top of each another, with many layers bringing along their own notion of control and feedback loops. Functionality might be duplicated across different layers, e.g., flow control in the application and on transport layer, leading to nested control loops, which might be coupled due to the timing constraints.

From the application layer end-to-end perspective the mobile network protocols seem to simply increase the depths of the protocol stack. Still, there are effects present that are specific to wireless access and mobile networks differ from the notion of an underlying wired ``dumb'' bit pipe.

First, typical effects of wireless connectivity relating to physical phenomena like fading and interference can be observed. Interruptions in the radio link are a major source of packet loss and spiking delay.
The overall delay in a mobile network is also strongly dependent on the mobile network technology used and has considerably decreased over the last few specification evolutions, even the core network. This was investigated in  \cite{laner2011dissecting3gdelay}. But even with the latest version is the \gls{RAB} and \gls{gtp} tunnel setup --- as previously described in \ref{c4:3gpparchitecture} --- sufficiently lengthy to be measurable and influence packet delay on initiating connections \cite{arlos2010packetsizedelayinfluence}.

To save radio and network resources devices usually have to quickly release their alloted slots causing additional delay for applications during connection reestablishment. Moreover, mobile networks offer many control options and parameters that can further influence any of the upper layers. Mobile devices have the tendency to be somewhat sensitive to some of these changes. For example, the authors of \cite{sigcomm11middleboxes} show the impact from protocol manipulations conducted by middleboxes. 

Comparing all these factors to wired protocols such as 802.3 Ethernet it is clear, that much more can happen in the mobile stack. Today Ethernet is a point to point protocol, transmission delay depends only on very few predictable factors, such as the distance. Wired access is typically not conducted solely through Ethernet, but with access technologies such as \gls{DSL} using \gls{PPPoE} or cable with \gls{DOCSIS}. While they also add more layers to wired access, they should be by far less influencing than the mobile stack. The latter has to additionally manage mobility and the shared wireless radio medium with protocols such as \gls{RLC} and \gls{RRC}.

A further details is the interaction between mobile network frame sizes and the \gls{IP} \gls{MTU}. Usually \gls{IP} adapts its packet size to the shortest frame size of all the link layer links in the path using \gls{PMTU} discovery as described in \cite{rfc1191}. Unfortunately, this can not work in \gls{3G} mobile networks, user packets are transparently fragmented by the radio protocols to fit into the transmission slots alloted to the device. For example, a \gls{GPRS} transmission slot has a length of only \SI{576.9}{\micro\second} carrying just \SI{114}{\bit}. And in \gls{UMTS} \SI{40}{\byte} of payload are typically carried in each \gls{RLC} frame (with optional header compression in the \gls{PDCP} layer).

This fragmentation is another source of an undesired interaction between \gls{3G}'s link layer and everything above and including the network layer, potentially fragmenting packets over a long period and thereby causing delay.

In a neutral network, all packets are treated the same and should be subject to the same \gls{RTT} influencing sources.
However, delays in the delivery of data to the upper layers can occur due to certain protocol features, such as \gls{TCP} retransmissions. After being detected through timers or duplicate acknowledgments any lost packet is automatically retransmitted by the sender. Therefore, loss from the lower layers is hidden from the application layer at the cost of delay variations and probably increased overall delay. The increase in delay is especially noteworthy in any \gls{3G} cellular network with its notion of link layer \gls{ARQ} and mobility. With the latter concept, transmissions originally running through one radio tower are redirected to a new tower after a handover, even if the handover period was lengthy. These two combined can be the source of very high delay, reaching seconds to even hundreds of seconds, when moving quickly between coverage areas (e.g., in a car or train). 
This also causes bad interactions with \gls{TCP}, as these long-delayed segments are thought to be lost and subsequently retransmitted, resulting in an even further increase of delay and delay jitter.

Another undesirable influence factor is caused by each packet buffer in the transmission's path. The effect occurs if the size of the buffer is not chosen carefully and the following link is a bottleneck link. Additionally, memory is very cheap, so hardware vendors tend to plug in as much as they can and advertise it as a feature. Packets may be kept unnecessarily long in these buffers, heavily increasing packet delay and diminishing \gls{TCP}'s ability to adapt itself to its fair share with the congestion control mechanisms~\cite{jacobson1988congestion,scharf2011comparison}. These mechanisms rely on feedback from the network by inducing packet loss which does not happen in a timely manner in case of large buffers. This phenomenon is called \textit{Bufferbloat}, and can induce latency as high as several seconds~\cite{gettys2011bufferbloat,groenewegen2011detecting}. And this is in addition to the latency in mobile networks, that is already high and unreliable to begin with.

Buffers are necessary to compensate for short-term variations in the traffic load and avoid loss in these situations. A popular countermeasure are \gls{AQM} methods, that control the size of the buffer and selectively drop packets if necessary. Although, most of these are never widely used because of configuration issues. One particular algorithm stands out, that is becoming increasingly popular: CoDel~\cite{Nichols:2012:CQD:2209249.2209264, nichols2014codel}.

CoDel measures the time it takes for a packet to pass through a buffer and begins dropping packets once a certain limit has been surpassed in a predefined interval. This and other similar mechanisms that control queue delay and not its size have begun to appear and be used in several places, e.g. in the Linux Kernel.

Up to the point of the transport layer the layers are pretty well defined, with only a few select protocols to choose from, all with well known influence factors on the mobile network. The application layer has a different notion, though. Adhering to the end-to-end design principles most innovation (and therefore change) will take place at the utmost ends, i.e., the application layer. Even when only considering video streaming applications the protocol variations are countless as the overview and classification in Section~\ref{c3:background} demonstrated. 

In streaming over mobile networks the video buffer size has to be in the range of seconds to compensate for most eventualities as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales}. And every streaming protocol has slightly different time scales and feedback loops.

As is the case in any best-effort network no bandwidth, latency, or loss guarantees can be given. The available bandwidth might get unexpectedly smaller resulting in a quickly draining video buffer if it was chosen too small. Then again, given sufficient bandwidth stability or at least predictability, buffer sizes could also be kept at a bare minimum, thereby enabling or improving real-time interactivity. In addition to a fitting choice of the buffering and playback strategies the choice of segment length and quality levels in adaptive streaming also plays an influential role in mobile networks. Most of these factors were discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:streaming}.

In layered network models individual functions are strictly separated and stacked on top of each other with well-defined \glspl{API} connecting them. To achieve complete separation without cross-influences, the feedback and control loops of each layer also would need to operate on completely disjoint time scales.

Looking again at Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales}, it can be seen that this notion is only partly supported and the loops of adjacent layers typically overlap somewhat. Protocols and implementations need to be aware of this circumstance and able to handle cross-layer influences.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Recent and Upcoming Protocols}

Protocol development has not stopped in recent years. On the contrary, some interesting changes are occurring especially in the application and transport layers. The following paragraph highlight some of the changes and their potential influence on mobile streaming.

Beginning at the transport layer some alternative approaches to \gls{TCP} are available, as especially the retransmission reliability has proven to be problematic in mobile networks as discussed. Typically, \gls{TCP} is used nonetheless because of two reasons: First, having congestion control is an absolute necessity to achieve an equal fair share and avoid congestive collapse and would otherwise have to be implemented in the application layer when using just \gls{UDP}. This generates additional implementation work and simultaneously reduces portability and compatibility to other congestion control variants --- the term \textit{TCP friendliness} has been used here. Second, due to many middleboxes simply dropping any unrecognized protocol --- exempting \gls{UDP} and \gls{TCP} --- the transport layer protocol often can not be changed at will and new transport protocol approaches would need to layer themselves atop \gls{UDP} incurring additional overhead.

These following three are examples of transport protocols each created with different goals in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{DCCP}~\cite{rfc4340} extends \gls{UDP} with data flows and \gls{TCP}-compatible congestion control omitting the strict retransmission feature.

\item The \gls{LEDBAT}~\cite{rfc6817} congestion control algorithm which is implemented, amongst others, in \gls{uTP}~\cite{bt2010utp} used in file-sharing. Traffic using \gls{LEDBAT} is of high volume, high elasticity, and low priority. Data handled by this congestion control approach gets displaced by any other data if the algorithm detects an increase in the transmission buffer delay.

\item \gls{QUIC}\footnote{\url{http://lwn.net/Articles/558826/} and \url{http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-tsvarea-10.pdf}} is a further experimental approach aimed at reducing sources of latency spikes which would occur in \gls{TCP}, such as retransmissions or the initial handshake. Some reliability is achieved through \gls{FEC} schemes if desired. Furthermore, a novel congestion control mechanism based on packet pacing, not through a traditional congestion window, and encryption by default are implemented. However, it is not intended as a production protocol but is rather a testbed for future mechanisms and modifications to existing protocols.
\end{itemize}

In the wake of Edward Snowden's surveillance and man-in-the-middle reveals, uncovering programs such as \todo{citation needed} the \gls{IETF} announced its position on these issues in \gls{RFC}~6973~\cite{rfc6973} suggesting, that all future standardized protocols should consider surveillance issues and minimize or prevent any attempt. Ultimately, this might lead to a end-to-end \textit{crypto-by-default} Internet, with every protocol providing at least opportunistic encryption. The first signs are already visible in today's traffic mix, with many Websites only available through \acrshort{HTTPS} --- using \gls{TLS}~\cite{rfc5246} --- any more. Similarly most e-mail providers have moved to \acrshort{IMAPS} and \acrshort{SMTPS}, even using new authentication and key exchange techniques like \gls{DANE}~\cite{rfc6698} which in turn relies on \gls{DNSSEC}~\cite{rfc4033} to authenticate the validity of \gls{DNS} entries. For example, the current draft version of HTTP2 --- which will be described in more detail shortly --- mandates the presence, albeit not the usage, of \gls{TLS} capability in both client and server. And even the connectionless \gls{UDP} can be secured using \gls{DTLS}~\cite{rfc6347}.

Usually, an additional intermediate layer is added through the encryption process, adding more timing interdependencies to the other layers. However, end-to-end encryption also diminishes the influence of most middleboxes as they are not able to alter the contents of the --- now encrypted --- segment any more.


Moving on to the application layer, some interesting developments have occurred in the Web's stack and in its use of \gls{HTTP} which almost all reliable streaming methods facilitate.

The original HTTP/1.0 specification is from the year 1996 with only one update to HTTP/1.1 in 1999 thereafter. Since then, no changes have been made to the core protocol. The number of use cases facilitating \gls{HTTP} has increased significantly, bringing with them a lot of long-standing issues that were not though of initially.

The typical number of individual \gls{HTTP} requests for one Web page has steadily increased, reaching today over \numprint{100} objects.\footnote{\url{http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/} and \url{http://www.httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&minlabel=Nov+15+2010&maxlabel=Jul+1+2014} and \url{https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/web-metrics}} \gls{HTTP} deals with this through persistent connections and pipelining to avoid unnecessary connection establishment and request delays. Pipelining is however disabled in almost every client implementation as it suffers from head-of-line blocking. To circumvent this problem and increase retrieval speed, browsers have begun to open many parallel \gls{TCP} connections per site, invoking significant overhead and general fairness issues due to the large number of \gls{TCP} connections displacing other traffic.

Moreover, the Web's structure has changed in such a way, that it is now common to push data to the clients to increase a Web page's interactivity. However, \gls{HTTP} is a simple client-initiated request-response protocol and pushing can only be emulated using techniques such as \textit{long polling} which imposes several restrictions and state overhead. Both these issues also affect reliable streaming with \gls{HTTP} to a certain degree. Streaming can benefit from a reduction of request latency as well as servers pushing adequate video segments at the correct time without the need for further requests.

To combat the situation and increase the protocol's interactivity along with it, several approaches are being developed. The first, WebSocket~\cite{rfc6455}, is a transport protocol on top of \gls{TCP} (or \gls{TLS}) that can be established through a regular \gls{HTTP} connection. It enables full-duplex communication between the two communication nodes. An additional \gls{W3C} \gls{API}~\cite{w3c2011websockets} enables simple usage in browsers with higher interactivity than plain \gls{HTTP}. It is also used to stream content to a browser.

The \acrshort{WebRTC} protocol suite\footnote{\url{http://www.webrtc.org/}}~\cite{webrtcdraft} even goes a step further and provides a complete stack for multimedia communication. It is intended to be used --- through the provided \gls{API} --- for direct browser-to-browser communication initiated by a central server-side Web page.

Both these techniques aim to enhance or sidestep \gls{HTTP}. But it is also desirable to improve the protocol itself for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, in 2010 Google implemented a new experimental application protocol called SPDY as an alternative to \gls{HTTP} in its browser Chrome accompanied by a draft specification~\cite{google2011SPDYdef, google2010SPDYwp}. Every major browser and most Web servers support SPDY, many Cloud and \gls{CDN} providers have it enabled.

SPDY uses the same port as \acrshort{HTTPS} (443) and mandates the use of \gls{TLS} as it also serves to negotiate the choice between \gls{HTTP} and SPDY. Compared to \gls{HTTP} pipelining, SPDY provides full-duplex time-division multiplexing. After an initial request of a Web page, the server can anticipate any follow-up requests, push objects on additional streams with assigned priorities and therefore avoid additional request round trips.

All of the SPDY changes are aimed at reducing the number of established \gls{TCP} connections for a Web site retrieval, ideally down to one, and reduce the overall latency of the object transmissions. Evaluations in \cite{google2010SPDYwp} suggest an average Web page load time reduction of \SI{29}{\percent}. The gains for networks with high latency, e.g., mobile networks, the gain could be even higher as several round trips are avoided.

Some of the benefits are also applicable to reliable streaming, with video segments being able to be pushed from the server. Conjoined with \gls{SVC}, SPDY could multiplex the different video layers in one connection, with the highest priority assigned to the base layer.

The SPDY draft was later picked up by the \gls{IETF} Httpbis working group as an initial basis basis for the \gls{HTTP} 2.0 specification~\cite{http20draft} currently being finalized as of mid 2014. It follows the SPDY specs rather closely, with the only major difference being the use of \gls{TLS}. Its usage is not mandated anymore, merely its presence and, if used, the application of strong and ephemeral cipher suites.

\subsection{Additional TCP Changes}

In addition to the previously described new transport protocols under development aiming to replace and surpass \gls{TCP}, \gls{TCP} itself is not as static as it may seem. While the basic wire frame and data interchange format has already been defined in 1981 in RFC~793~\cite{rfc793}, much of the specific behavior is free to be experimented with by further specifications and implementations. The most prominent example is the congestion control mechanism where every operating system takes different approaches.

Every one of these changes can have unforeseen repercussions or great benefits for the application layer. The following paragraphs investigate some of the changes in the last few years and their implications.  Instead of implicitly exploring specific mechanism choices of closed source \glspl{os} and tracking their changes over the years, which would be extremely difficult, the \gls{TCP} implementation in the Linux kernel is taken as an example. The changes can be easily tracked by crawling through the patch sets and their commit logs of every kernel version. Sites like \url{http://kernelnewbies.org/} and \url{http://lwn.net/} simplify this process even more. Table~\ref{c5:tab:linux-stack-changes} depicts such an attempt to track the major changes affecting \gls{TCP} in the kernel.

\subsection{Proposal for Cross-Layer Enhancements}
\label{c5:crosslayerhinting}


Wired Internet access has a very narrow choice of protocols on the \gls{ISO}/\gls{OSI} Layers 1 and 2. The typical use-case consists of a \gls{LAN} using Ethernet which is then tunneled through or translated into one of several access technologies, e.g., \gls{DSL}, \gls{DOCSIS}, or \gls{PON}. Applications often make assumptions that rely on the presence of these protocols and their specific characteristics.

However, Internet access today is similarly often achieved using mobile cellular networks. The latest standardized iteration of these is \gls{LTE} and the accompanying \gls{EPS} core network infrastructure \cite{olsson2009sae}. This is the first evolution of standards that completely removes the classical circuit switched domain making room for more radio frequency bandwidth to be used with the all-\gls{IP} services achieving shared transmission capacities --- comparable to today's 802.11n WiFi --- albeit on much larger cell sizes of \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} to \SI{3}{\kilo\meter}. The \gls{EPS} network acts as an intermediary between the radio access stations and the Internet enabling strong traffic control mechanisms as well as mobility anchored at the \gls{SGW}. Traffic is routed through the core by using tunneling over the \gls{SGW} and \gls{PGW} based on the traffic bearer concept defined either in the \gls{gtp} or the \gls{PMIPv6} protocols. For every mobile device connected to the network there is one default and up to ten dedicated bearers carrying traffic filtered by pre-set \gls{QoS} parameters. Control is enforced through a logically separate network control plane, that is also used to setup and tear down these bearers. Figure fig:ltestack displays the disparity between the Internet's protocol stack and that of an \gls{LTE} network encapsulating all user traffic in additional protocol layers by the tunneling process.

Research work is ongoing how to best work with this complex network setup. It is expected, that with the rise of mobile access the core network comes under heavy traffic pressure with negative affects on the \gls{QoS} of best-effort traffic. Endeavors are required to study the loaded network's behavior. Also very little work has gone into exploring the control plane characteristics of these networks, including their performance. A novel approach could also be, to make mobile device applications, e.g. video streaming players, aware of the core networks capabilities and allow the request of tunnels tailored to their specific \gls{QoS} requirements resulting in a possible increase of perceived quality.

% influence of signaling plane and core network elements - scaling

The protocols used for the radio transmissions behave very differently when compared to Ethernet and assumptions made by higher layers may not hold any more. This can apply to, e.g., reliability, frame sizing and fragmenting, and latency amounting to undesired effects on higher-layer traffic. For example, loss in \gls{GSM} and \gls{UMTS} networks is often caught transparently on layer 2 and a retransmission is conducted. However, in the time the retransmission takes the transport layer may have already run into a timeout and re-requested the missing segment on its own, resulting in additional delay and a waste of bandwidth. This is especially detrimental for time-critical applications like video streaming, possibly resulting in buffer underruns and degraded quality. Transport and application layer mechanisms need to be able to understand this and cope with the effects. E.g., \gls{TCP} retransmissions and congestion control could be adjusted in the course of understanding this.

Furthermore, traffic could be avoided during cell handover occurrences. This would require cross-layer cooperation and an awareness of the application when an handover is supposed to occur. The application then could schedule its traffic accordingly. Traffic falling into a handover is subject to especially high latency and loss because the mobile network acts as a mobility anchor which needs to internally reroute incoming traffic to the mobile device's new position. \gls{HTTP} traffic is especially suited to this scheduling behavior because of its statelessness and consistence of small objects that can be requested and transferred independently.

\subsubsection{Cross-Layer Mobility Hinting}

Today's mobile networks are all of a cellular design. A device that moves from one cell to the other has to perform a so-called handover. During this process the device is deregistered in one cell and registered in the new one. All network traffic currently in flight has to be rerouted or relayed to the device's new location. 
Although seemingly transparent to the device's application, adverse side effects can occur during a handover, including an increase and variability of latency. 

Mobility support today always means network assisted mobility. Typically, the network decides the best possible mobility strategy from its point of view and provides infrastructure to support seamless handovers in the form of mobility anchor nodes. However, the device is actually in a very unique position, as it knows a great deal more about its traffic mix, its currently running applications and its user than the network ever could and should.
Unfortunately, most of this information remains unused, as today's network infrastructures and lower layer protocol stacks provide only very slim changes to exert control over decisions regarding the device.

Nonetheless, a lot could still be done when providing the device's operating system and application ecosystem with a simple bidirectional pathway for vertical information and control flow across network protocol layers and to other low-level systems. This work aims to do just that by providing a generic interface and exchange protocol for any kind of information relevant to an application's decision making process. With this meaningful actions and reactions of individual layers can be defined and tested. Possible use cases are provided in the next section.

Still, one has also to keep in mind, that layering and encapsulation is there for a reason and violating this is a rather risky undertaking. However, we do not think that our approach actually violates these basic principles and only extends on the ways one can communicate and interact with all individual layers without changing anything in them.


	% - Research objectives
	% 	- Bidirectional vertical information and control flow on the performance of the individual layers
	% 		- Definition of generic interfaces
	% 		- Definition of a protocol (including information types, etc.)
	% 	- Definition of meaningful actions/reactions on the individual layers (e.g. adaptation of real-time communication data sources or changes in resource allocation)

		

\subsubsection{Scenario Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Video/Voice calls that notify the other party, that interruptions are expected to occur.

	\item Using current location data and movement patterns/predictions to improve cell selections and initiate horizontal and vertical handovers to a time suitable for the device and running applications.

			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mockup of handover prediction and hinting for adaptive streaming and thus avoiding playback stalls.}
	\label{c5:fig:streaming-hinting}
	\end{figure}

	\item An adaptive streaming video application increases its video buffer when a shortly upcoming handover is announced to survive the service outage. This can be achieved by an increased rate of segment retrieval and a reduction in segment quality. The goal is to avoid any possible playback stalls due to the handover. Figure~\ref{c5:fig:streaming-hinting} demonstrates this circumstance.

	\begin{figure}[htb]
	        \centering
	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
	            \centering

				\caption{The handover will block currently active object transmissions, page display will be delayed.}

				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/http-reorder-cl.pdf}
				\caption{The browser reorders the objects to be retrieved and avoids any transmissions during the indicated handover period.}

			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mock-up of \gls{HTTP} reordering with handover awareness.}
	\label{c5:fig:http-reorder}
	\end{figure}

	\item Enable applications to adapt themselves to the conditions currently experienced by the networking stack and its sensors. For example, a Web browser could reorder its Website object requests to avoid sending any requests during handover periods and experience additional delay as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:http-reorder}.

	\item A cross-layer enabled device can also offer a wide range of policy choices to its applications or even directly to the user. An example rule could be: ``Do not handover to a stationary WiFi from 3G when moving faster than 50km/h, only to in-vehicle WiFi.'' or ``Avoid any vertical handover, which would interrupt my service for a long time, while this VoIP call is running.''

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Implementation}

The Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Userspace daemon that collects information from kernelspace protocol implementations and sensors and provides them to all applications.
	\item shared bus control/information system, instead of explicit comm; signaling only to interested parties
	\item provide common interface also to all available sensors and layer 1 and 2 network information and control (similar to Android)
	\item IPC message bus, possibly D-Bus\footnote{\url{http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/}} based
	\item Could extend NetworkManager\footnote{\url{https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager}}, some functionality is already provided there

\end{itemize}

The process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tell Transport/Application the expected time till handover / time of uninterrupted service
\item Tell Transport/App expected connection parameters (latency, BW, ...)
\item Application selects \gls{DASH} stream appropriate to parameters
\item Application reorders \gls{HTTP} GETs so that large GETs are not interrupted
\item Application stops transfers when handover is about to occur
\item Layer 1/2 gives a list of possible handovers to Application
\item Application selects (better: suggests) handover which fits best and reorders accordingly
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Example Benefits}

Put into relation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item frequency of handovers / distance/density of radio towers vs scenario traveling speed
	\item bit-length of streaming segments, typical transmission speed
	\item typical video length and number of segments
	\item derive number of interruptions in segments due to handovers
	\item estimate typical handover/mobility duration and service interruption time per event
	\item sum it up and compare to crosslayer information or even application layer handover decision

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Planned Work and Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
	\item investigate how much information is exposed and what can already be done
	\item Analysis of data traces and realistic simulations in order to capture in detail the unwanted phenomena
	\item Verify the suitability of the State-of-the-Art algorithms and protocols which address this problem
\end{itemize}

%Characteristics of UDP packet loss: Effect of tcp traffic \cite{sawashima97characteristics}


% CoDel:
%  Head drop not tail drop
%  Queues only as shock absorbers
%  What matters is the delay within a flow
%  CoDel measures minimal packet pass through time in the local device buffer during a defined interval
%  If minimum gets too high, too much buffering is happening
%  If delay value does not once fall below a target in the interval CoDel will start dropping packets
% 	Signals congestion and hopefully reduces source rate
% 	If stays above target, progressively more packets are dropped
% 	Target: 5ms; interval: 100ms, based on simulation results
%  Can be enabled in Linux since 3.5, but many NIC drivers do not support it yet
%  Every buffer along the path influences transmission
% 	Most impact on the node before the bottleneck
% 	Cell towers, dsl/cable modems, ...

%but successful protocols develop de-facto; de jure much harder (see \gls{3G})


%protocols without retransmission feature (lost packets are not relevant and cause head-of-line blocking) but still with the all-important congestion control + TLS
%inherits new TCP features such as TFO, snap start, ...
%congestion control not through CWND but through packet pacing
%includes stream multiplexing and TLS-like crypto by default


% Multiplexing/Streams:
%  Control and Data Frames, with header compression
%  Stream interleaving/multiplexing or cancellation

%  Stream priorities (8 levels)
% 	Prefer essential resources over others (images)
% 	Prefer data with earlier deadlines? (E.g. load next few video streams immediately while already requesting more)

% Evaluations:
% 	Average reduction in page load time: ~29\%; 27\% - 60\%
% 	Strongly dependent on connection, server environment
% 	HTTP/1.1 optimization (resources split on multiple domains) prevents SPDY multiplexing gains
%  SPDY could be more susceptible to packet loss and TCP congestion window downscaling
% 	Only one connection used compared to multiple HTTP/1.1
