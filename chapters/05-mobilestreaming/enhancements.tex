\section{Recent Developments in the Mobile Network Stack}
\label{c5:sec:stack-enhancements}


Contrary to the popular scientific belief, that the Internet is unable to change and renew itself (so called Internet ``ossification'', compare, e.g., \cite{feldmann2010ossification}), protocols in the \gls{TCP}/\gls{IP} stack change all the time. Changes are more likely to occur in the end-to-end stack behavior and not in the packet format, as they are more difficult to change. New application requirements and changing network architectures always trigger adaptations in the stack in-between. 

This section briefly covers the existing protocol stacks in relation to mobile networks and streaming, new protocols and how they might influence the stack, and also discusses \gls{TCP} more closely as an example. Beneficial interactions between the stack's layers are presented in a final part.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Influences of the Existing Stack}

Superficially not much has changed in the Web's protocol stack. There is still \gls{IP}, \gls{TCP}, and \gls{HTTP} forming effectively the same protocol stack since 1991 with HTTP/0.9. And this seems hard to change, especially the transport layer is fixed to \gls{UDP} and \gls{TCP}, everything else will probably get rejected, altered or even dropped by one of the numerous middleboxes, such as \glspl{NAT}, or forced ``traffic optimization'' transparent proxies, all of which are especially prevalent in mobile networks \cite{sigcomm11middleboxes}. As a side note, this adds another layer of state kept in the network. A fact that was already discussed as being highly problematic and capable of inducing load in the core network in Chapter~\ref{chap:mobilenets}.

Each protocol, representing a layer in the stack, characteristically contributes to influencing data transmissions and varies in its degree of impact on the network as well as the intended goal of the transmission (e.g., streaming and watching a video).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/layer-timescales.pdf}
	\caption{Approximate discernible time scales the networking stack protocols operate on in each layer.}
\label{c5:fig:timescales}
\end{figure}

Associated with each layer, and with the actual application running on top of the stack as well, are different timing constraints or time constants of control. Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales} overviews the approximate time scales on which activities take place, spanning a remarkable range of twelve orders of magnitude. Complexity is introduced by stacking multiple layers on top of each another, with many layers bringing along their own notion of control and feedback loops. Functionality might be duplicated across different layers, e.g., flow control in the application and on transport layer, leading to nested control loops, which might be coupled due to the timing constraints.

From the application layer end-to-end perspective the mobile network protocols seem to simply increase the depths of the protocol stack. Still, there are effects present that are specific to wireless access and mobile networks differ from the notion of an underlying wired ``dumb'' bit pipe.

First, typical effects of wireless connectivity relating to physical phenomena like fading and interference can be observed. Interruptions in the radio link are a major source of packet loss and spiking delay.
The overall delay in a mobile network is also strongly dependent on the mobile network technology used and has considerably decreased over the last few specification evolutions, even the core network. This was investigated in  \cite{laner2011dissecting3gdelay}. But even with the latest version is the \gls{RAB} and \gls{gtp} tunnel setup --- as previously described in \ref{c4:3gpparchitecture} --- sufficiently lengthy to be measurable and influence packet delay on initiating connections \cite{arlos2010packetsizedelayinfluence}.

To save radio and network resources devices usually have to quickly release their alloted slots causing additional delay for applications during connection reestablishment. Moreover, mobile networks offer many control options and parameters that can further influence any of the upper layers. Mobile devices have the tendency to be somewhat sensitive to some of these changes. For example, the authors of \cite{sigcomm11middleboxes} show the impact from protocol manipulations conducted by middleboxes. 

Comparing all these factors to wired protocols such as 802.3 Ethernet it is clear, that much more can happen in the mobile stack. Today Ethernet is a point to point protocol, transmission delay depends only on very few predictable factors, such as the distance. Wired access is typically not conducted solely through Ethernet, but with access technologies such as \gls{DSL} using \gls{PPPoE} or cable with \gls{DOCSIS}. While they also add more layers to wired access, they should be by far less influencing than the mobile stack. The latter has to additionally manage mobility and the shared wireless radio medium with protocols such as \gls{RLC} and \gls{RRC}.

A further details is the interaction between mobile network frame sizes and the \gls{IP} \gls{MTU}. Usually \gls{IP} adapts its packet size to the shortest frame size of all the link layer links in the path using \gls{PMTU} discovery as described in \cite{rfc1191}. Unfortunately, this can not work in \gls{3G} mobile networks, user packets are transparently fragmented by the radio protocols to fit into the transmission slots alloted to the device. For example, a \gls{GPRS} transmission slot has a length of only \SI{576.9}{\micro\second} carrying just \SI{114}{\bit}. And in \gls{UMTS} \SI{40}{\byte} of payload are typically carried in each \gls{RLC} frame (with optional header compression in the \gls{PDCP} layer).

This fragmentation is another source of an undesired interaction between \gls{3G}'s link layer and everything above and including the network layer, potentially fragmenting packets over a long period and thereby causing delay.

In a neutral network, all packets are treated the same and should be subject to the same \gls{RTT} influencing sources.
However, delays in the delivery of data to the upper layers can occur due to certain protocol features, such as \gls{TCP} retransmissions. After being detected through timers or duplicate acknowledgments any lost packet is automatically retransmitted by the sender. Therefore, loss from the lower layers is hidden from the application layer at the cost of delay variations and probably increased overall delay. The increase in delay is especially noteworthy in any \gls{3G} cellular network with its notion of link layer \gls{ARQ} and mobility. With the latter concept, transmissions originally running through one radio tower are redirected to a new tower after a handover, even if the handover period was lengthy. These two combined can be the source of very high delay, reaching seconds to even hundreds of seconds, when moving quickly between coverage areas (e.g., in a car or train). 
This also causes bad interactions with \gls{TCP}, as these long-delayed segments are thought to be lost and subsequently retransmitted, resulting in an even further increase of delay and delay jitter.

´
Another undesirable influence factor is caused by each packet buffer in the transmission's path. The effect occurs if the size of the buffer is not chosen carefully and the following link is a bottleneck link. Additionally, memory is very cheap, so hardware vendors tend to plug in as much as they can and advertise it as a feature. Packets may be kept unnecessarily long in these buffers, heavily increasing packet delay and diminishing \gls{TCP}'s ability to adapt itself to its fair share with the congestion control mechanisms~\cite{jacobson1988congestion,scharf2011comparison}. These mechanisms rely on feedback from the network by inducing packet loss which does not happen in a timely manner in case of large buffers. This phenomenon is called \textit{Bufferbloat}, and can induce latency as high as several seconds~\cite{gettys2011bufferbloat,groenewegen2011detecting}. And this is in addition to the latency in mobile networks, that is already high and unreliable to begin with.

Buffers are necessary to compensate for short-term variations in the traffic load and avoid loss in these situations. A popular countermeasure are \gls{AQM} methods, that control the size of the buffer and selectively drop packets if necessary. Although, most of these are never widely used because of configuration issues. One particular algorithm stands out, that is becoming increasingly popular: CoDel~\cite{Nichols:2012:CQD:2209249.2209264, nichols2014codel}.

CoDel measures the time it takes for a packet to pass through a buffer and begins dropping packets once a certain limit has been surpassed in a predefined interval. This and other similar mechanisms that control queue delay and not its size have begun to appear and be used in several places, e.g. in the Linux Kernel.



Up to the point of the transport layer the layers are pretty well defined, with only a few select protocols to choose from, all with well known influence factors on the mobile network. The application layer comes with a different notion, though. Even when only considering video streaming applications

% ! <-- !


There exists a diversity of streaming applications and associated application-layer protocols, each supporting to differing degrees certain types of streaming, and each having its own set of requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Content type --- Pre-generated (as for example in case of video sharing web sites) or live (e.g. televised sports events, news feeds)
\item Codec --- adaptive, variable, or constant media bitrate
\item Playback control and quality feedback --- client/server-side, implicit/explicit
\end{itemize}
Adhering to the design space limits present on the Internet, most innovation takes place on the application layer.
With each streaming protocol come slightly different time scales and feedback loops. Looking at reliable streaming...

%Application Layer Protocols
%using TLS or not
%Firefox Patch: Sort Idle HTTP Connections by CWND \cite{ffSortCWND}


%Application Behavior
As indicated in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales}, the time scale on which streaming applications buffer content lie in the range of seconds. This is a necessity in a best-effort network, as the available network bitrate might drop unexpectedly and could drain a shallower buffer quickly. On the other hand, given sufficient bandwidth, buffer sizes could be reduced, improving interactivity of the stream and enabling closer-to-realtime live streaming or conferencing.
Buffering and playback strategies in current applications are such a pivotal point in the operation of video streaming in mobile networks as discussion in Chapter~\ref{chap:streaming}.

%Cross-Layer Influences
Layered network models often assume the functional separation of network layers. The timescales shown in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:timescales} partly support this notion, but also show that there are conflicts in the speed of control loops that can be implemented. Indeed, actual protocols and hardware need to be aware of and often explicitly exploit cross-layer influences and information flow.
\gls{TCP} is an example for this: Its tracking of a congestion window reflects not the state of the transport, but of the network and lower layers. Congestion is assumed by \gls{TCP} if segments are lost (or unduly delayed) below the transport layer. Consequently, if loss happens on the lower layers for reasons other than congestion, \gls{TCP} reacts in an inappropriate way. As indicated in the previous section, loss and delay spikes may have many root causes in a wireless network, and loss might be concealed altogether through lower-layer retransmission methods.
Another example concerning \gls{TCP} is the \gls{PMTU} discovery. Here, \gls{TCP} probes the largest segment size that can be transmitted by the host-to-network layer in one transmission, e.g., Ethernet frame, using \gls{IP}'s ``Don't Fragment'' signaling. Again, a mobile network does not behave the same way an \gls{IP}/Ethernet-based network would work, as it conceals its actual \gls{MTU} and reports it can transport full Ethernet frames.
In addition to (probably inadvertent) behavioral differences between ``classical'' wireline / Ethernet-based and cellular mobile Internet, an \gls{LTE} mobile network typically lies within the administrative domain of one single operator, and thus offers significantly more control over data flows. Through appropriate policies tailored to the user, their subscription model, and other factors such as the overall network status, bearers in the network can be configured for all types of services. Depending on the bearers' quality settings, the operator can support (or, to the contrary, penalize) streaming traffic.

The problem of protocols drawing wrong conclusions due to wireline assumptions has been described for \gls{TCP} above. It is foreseeable that a similar set of problems will appear when operators enforce different policies on Internet-based services without checking first the applicability of their traffic engineering methods. The methodology presented in this deliverable will help to understand beforehand the effects on the user that bearer quality settings have. Similarly, the methodology will present a set of tools to judge before engineering new hardware the capability of certain controls envisioned by the standards bodies, and if an implementation would turn out useful for a set of streaming services.

\subsection{Proposal for Cross-Layer Enhancements}
\label{c5:crosslayerhinting}


Wired Internet access has a very narrow choice of protocols on the \gls{ISO}/\gls{OSI} Layers 1 and 2. The typical use-case consists of a \gls{LAN} using Ethernet which is then tunneled through or translated into one of several access technologies, e.g., \gls{DSL}, \gls{DOCSIS}, or \gls{PON}. Applications often make assumptions that rely on the presence of these protocols and their specific characteristics.

However, Internet access today is similarly often achieved using mobile cellular networks. The latest standardized iteration of these is \gls{LTE} and the accompanying \gls{EPS} core network infrastructure \cite{olsson2009sae}. This is the first evolution of standards that completely removes the classical circuit switched domain making room for more radio frequency bandwidth to be used with the all-\gls{IP} services achieving shared transmission capacities --- comparable to today's 802.11n WiFi --- albeit on much larger cell sizes of \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} to \SI{3}{\kilo\meter}. The \gls{EPS} network acts as an intermediary between the radio access stations and the Internet enabling strong traffic control mechanisms as well as mobility anchored at the \gls{SGW}. Traffic is routed through the core by using tunneling over the \gls{SGW} and \gls{PGW} based on the traffic bearer concept defined either in the \gls{gtp} or the \gls{PMIPv6} protocols. For every mobile device connected to the network there is one default and up to ten dedicated bearers carrying traffic filtered by pre-set \gls{QoS} parameters. Control is enforced through a logically separate network control plane, that is also used to setup and tear down these bearers. Figure fig:ltestack displays the disparity between the Internet's protocol stack and that of an \gls{LTE} network encapsulating all user traffic in additional protocol layers by the tunneling process.

Research work is ongoing how to best work with this complex network setup. It is expected, that with the rise of mobile access the core network comes under heavy traffic pressure with negative affects on the \gls{QoS} of best-effort traffic. Endeavors are required to study the loaded network's behavior. Also very little work has gone into exploring the control plane characteristics of these networks, including their performance. A novel approach could also be, to make mobile device applications, e.g. video streaming players, aware of the core networks capabilities and allow the request of tunnels tailored to their specific \gls{QoS} requirements resulting in a possible increase of perceived quality.

% influence of signaling plane and core network elements - scaling

The protocols used for the radio transmissions behave very differently when compared to Ethernet and assumptions made by higher layers may not hold any more. This can apply to, e.g., reliability, frame sizing and fragmenting, and latency amounting to undesired effects on higher-layer traffic. For example, loss in \gls{GSM} and \gls{UMTS} networks is often caught transparently on layer 2 and a retransmission is conducted. However, in the time the retransmission takes the transport layer may have already run into a timeout and re-requested the missing segment on its own, resulting in additional delay and a waste of bandwidth. This is especially detrimental for time-critical applications like video streaming, possibly resulting in buffer underruns and degraded quality. Transport and application layer mechanisms need to be able to understand this and cope with the effects. E.g., \gls{TCP} retransmissions and congestion control could be adjusted in the course of understanding this.

Furthermore, traffic could be avoided during cell handover occurrences. This would require cross-layer cooperation and an awareness of the application when an handover is supposed to occur. The application then could schedule its traffic accordingly. Traffic falling into a handover is subject to especially high latency and loss because the mobile network acts as a mobility anchor which needs to internally reroute incoming traffic to the mobile device's new position. \gls{HTTP} traffic is especially suited to this scheduling behavior because of its statelessness and consistence of small objects that can be requested and transferred independently.

\subsubsection{Cross-Layer Mobility Hinting}

Today's mobile networks are all of a cellular design. A device that moves from one cell to the other has to perform a so-called handover. During this process the device is deregistered in one cell and registered in the new one. All network traffic currently in flight has to be rerouted or relayed to the device's new location. 
Although seemingly transparent to the device's application, adverse side effects can occur during a handover, including an increase and variability of latency. 

Mobility support today always means network assisted mobility. Typically, the network decides the best possible mobility strategy from its point of view and provides infrastructure to support seamless handovers in the form of mobility anchor nodes. However, the device is actually in a very unique position, as it knows a great deal more about its traffic mix, its currently running applications and its user than the network ever could and should.
Unfortunately, most of this information remains unused, as today's network infrastructures and lower layer protocol stacks provide only very slim changes to exert control over decisions regarding the device.

Nonetheless, a lot could still be done when providing the device's operating system and application ecosystem with a simple bidirectional pathway for vertical information and control flow across network protocol layers and to other low-level systems. This work aims to do just that by providing a generic interface and exchange protocol for any kind of information relevant to an application's decision making process. With this meaningful actions and reactions of individual layers can be defined and tested. Possible use cases are provided in the next section.

Still, one has also to keep in mind, that layering and encapsulation is there for a reason and violating this is a rather risky undertaking. However, we do not think that our approach actually violates these basic principles and only extends on the ways one can communicate and interact with all individual layers without changing anything in them.


	% - Research objectives
	% 	- Bidirectional vertical information and control flow on the performance of the individual layers
	% 		- Definition of generic interfaces
	% 		- Definition of a protocol (including information types, etc.)
	% 	- Definition of meaningful actions/reactions on the individual layers (e.g. adaptation of real-time communication data sources or changes in resource allocation)

		

\subsubsection{Scenario Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Video/Voice calls that notify the other party, that interruptions are expected to occur.

	\item Using current location data and movement patterns/predictions to improve cell selections and initiate horizontal and vertical handovers to a time suitable for the device and running applications.

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
	            \centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/adaptive-streaming-no-cl.pdf}
				\caption{Stalling occurs without handover hinting.}

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/adaptive-streaming-cl.pdf}
				\caption{Stalling can be prevented by hinting and proactively filling the playback buffer.}

			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mockup of handover prediction and hinting for adaptive streaming and thus avoiding playback stalls.}
	\label{c5:fig:streaming-hinting}
	\end{figure}

	\item An adaptive streaming video application increases its video buffer when a shortly upcoming handover is announced to survive the service outage. This can be achieved by an increased rate of segment retrieval and a reduction in segment quality. The goal is to avoid any possible playback stalls due to the handover. Figure~\ref{c5:fig:streaming-hinting} demonstrates this circumstance.

	\begin{figure}[htb]
	        \centering
	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
	            \centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/http-reorder-no-cl.pdf}
				\caption{The handover will block currently active object transmissions, page display will be delayed.}
				\label{c5:fig:http-reorder-no-cl}
	        \end{subfigure}%

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.90\textwidth}
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/http-reorder-cl.pdf}
				\caption{The browser reorders the objects to be retrieved and avoids any transmissions during the indicated handover period.}
				\label{c5:fig:http-reorder-cl}
			   \end{subfigure}%
	 \caption{Mock-up of \gls{HTTP} reordering with handover awareness.}
	\label{c5:fig:http-reorder}
	\end{figure}

	\item Enable applications to adapt themselves to the conditions currently experienced by the networking stack and its sensors. For example, a Web browser could reorder its Website object requests to avoid sending any requests during handover periods and experience additional delay as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:http-reorder}.

	\item A cross-layer enabled device can also offer a wide range of policy choices to its applications or even directly to the user. An example rule could be: ``Do not handover to a stationary WiFi from 3G when moving faster than 50km/h, only to in-vehicle WiFi.'' or ``Avoid any vertical handover, which would interrupt my service for a long time, while this VoIP call is running.''

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Implementation}

The Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Userspace daemon that collects information from kernelspace protocol implementations and sensors and provides them to all applications.
	\item shared bus control/information system, instead of explicit comm; signaling only to interested parties
	\item provide common interface also to all available sensors and layer 1 and 2 network information and control (similar to Android)
	\item IPC message bus, possibly D-Bus\footnote{\url{http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/}} based
	\item Could extend NetworkManager\footnote{\url{https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager}}, some functionality is already provided there

\end{itemize}

The process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tell Transport/Application the expected time till handover / time of uninterrupted service
\item Tell Transport/App expected connection parameters (latency, BW, ...)
\item Application selects \gls{DASH} stream appropriate to parameters
\item Application reorders \gls{HTTP} GETs so that large GETs are not interrupted
\item Application stops transfers when handover is about to occur
\item Layer 1/2 gives a list of possible handovers to Application
\item Application selects (better: suggests) handover which fits best and reorders accordingly
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Example Benefits}

Put into relation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item frequency of handovers / distance/density of radio towers vs scenario traveling speed
	\item bit-length of streaming segments, typical transmission speed
	\item typical video length and number of segments
	\item derive number of interruptions in segments due to handovers
	\item estimate typical handover/mobility duration and service interruption time per event
	\item sum it up and compare to crosslayer information or even application layer handover decision

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Planned Work and Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
	\item investigate how much information is exposed and what can already be done
	\item Analysis of data traces and realistic simulations in order to capture in detail the unwanted phenomena
	\item Verify the suitability of the State-of-the-Art algorithms and protocols which address this problem
\end{itemize}

%  If minimum gets too high, too much buffering is happening
%  If delay value does not once fall below a target in the interval CoDel will start dropping packets
