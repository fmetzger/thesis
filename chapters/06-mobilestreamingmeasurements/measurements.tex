\chapter{Evaluating Mobile Networks, Stacks, and Streaming}
\label{chap:mobilestreaming-measurements}

Testing and evaluation plays a crucial role not just in correctly utilizing cross-layer data but also for mobile networks in general. All of the discussed layer influences, interactions and other unintentional side-effects need to be thoroughly understood for the intended goal of optimizing video streaming in mobile networks.

The core network trace evaluations undertaken in Chapter~\ref{chap:mobilenets} were already able to highlight the load influencing dynamics of the core network control plane. But many more aspects remain uninvestigated, some of which may not even be covered by this kind of passive network-wide measurement type.

To further the understanding of the behavior of reliable streaming in mobile networks and investigate influence sources, usually either active measurements or simulations are conducted. Both methods are discussed here, with their drawbacks and benefits, and a working implementation --- tailored to the needs of measuring reliable mobile streaming --- is presented for each.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Active Measurements and Testbeds}

Active measurements includes any kind of approach that generates its own network traffic and bases the evaluation on it. Therefore, they are usually conducted on an end-to-end base, with at lest one side under the control of the experimenter.

Apart from researchers writing their own specialized application for a singular study, active measurements are most often conducted with the help of existing network testbeds, thereby reducing the overall effort.
Any new or an alteration to existing network protocols are usually best tested in large-scale network testbeds to collect performance data and find side-effects. The presence of background traffic and a large device heterogeneity and diversity are often considered an advantage to a testbed as it better resembles real networks.

Testbeds can be either physically constructed by setting up a number of dedicated machines in a lab or form a virtual overlay spanning over an existing computer network. Both of these principles work well for wired network and there are a lot of examples of successful testbeds constructed with these principles.

Currently one of the largest installations is PlanetLab~\cite{chun2003planetlab}, consisting of dedicated machines located at a number of University sites. An experimenter can instantiate a \textit{slice} --- a portion of the overlay network made up of number of interconnected \glspl{VM} hosted on the various machines --- and conduct her studies. Thus, many experiments can run concurrently.

Several testbeds devote themselves to wireless and mobile networks. These are usually either put together in a clean lab environment, SmartLab\footnote{\url{http://smartlab.cs.ucy.ac.cy/}} or 
EmuLab\footnote{\url{http://www.emulab.net/}} come to mind, or hand out subsidized mobile devices prepared with custom firmwares to volunteers which need to allow running network experiments on them. The approach is taken, e.g., by NetSense~\cite{Striegel:2013:LLN:2491159.2491171} and PhoneLab\footnote{\url{https://www.phone-lab.org/}}~\cite{Nandugudi:2013:PLP:2536714.2536718}. The latter approach raises some interesting issues concerning the volunteers' privacy which will be covered in the next section.

All of these testbeds consist of rather uniform nodes and access to it still requires some amount of administrative effort, alternative approaches are also available, for example in the form of the Seattle Testbed\footnote{\url{https://seattle.poly.edu/html/}}~\cite{Cappos:2009:SPE:1508865.1508905}. Its overlay network comprises of small software sandboxes installable on a wide range of device types. Experimenters gain automatic access to a portion of the overlay through a clearing house and are resource-restricted to their slice by a hypervisor. As Seattle is available to both conventional PCs as well as Android smartphones, the overlay composition very heterogeneous. Therefore, the node stability and availability can vary substantially over time, caused amongst other things by the individual uptime of the computers following typical diurnal cycles and mobility-related connectivity issues.
While this forms a much more realistic picture of a network, it simultaneously makes the execution of the actual study more difficult as these churning issues have to be dealt with.

The requirements for conducting reliable streaming experiments are low. As it is usually a fully pull-based approach, full control over the server containing the streaming files is not necessary. It is also generally not necessary to display the actual video on the client in reliable streaming as it always will be a pixel-perfect representation. Therefore, the buffer-emulation measurement approach presented in \ref{c3:measurements} can be employed here. The measurement devices only have to record the transmission traces of the streaming process and make them available to the emulation process. The latter can for example also be performed in a centralized and asynchronous matter when dealing with non-adaptive streaming.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Enriching Mobile Measurements with Additional Metadata}
\label{c6:sensorium}

While transmission traces might be the bare minimum to conduct reliable streaming measurements, meaningful mobile measurement can include much more metadata, giving insightful indication of the device's current state.

Mobile devices have access to a vast array of data. On the one hand does the networking stack itself much information on its state, as discussed in the previous Chapter. The current radio and mobility state is especially relevant to mobile streaming measurements as it directly influences the link's \gls{QoS} parameters. But modern mobile devices additionally contain an ever-growing number of sensors, including \gls{GPS}, accelerometers, temperature, pressure, luminosity, humidity, fingerprint, and several cameras and microphones. They each can help to quantify the physical position, orientation and state of the device and even quantify the state of its user.



(active) measurements in mobile networks should make use of the device's current state and environment. i.e., read its sensor data and put measurements in context with it. Alternatively, use anonymized sensor data for new kinds of evaluations (can this device watch video at all at the current location?)

Modern computing devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablet computers are equipped with an increasing number of sensors: \gls{GPS}, tilt, and acceleration meters quantify the physical position and orientation of the device; 3G, WiFi, and other  interfaces gather data on the availability and signal quality of wireless networks; temperature and ambient light sensors deliver additional insight into a user's work and home environments.

\subsubsection{Preserving Privacy}



critical element for acceptance of an active network measurement mobile app is to preserve the privacy of the participating users. This is especially true for free-form network testbeds, that allow running arbitrary experiments or even code. Access to sensitive data has to be regulated, filtered, adjusted, or even outright prevented. Even more concerning (for privacy reasons) but also raising hope (for scientific experimentation) is the steadily rising number of sensors in mobile devices. Nowadays included are even heartbeat monitors and fingerprint sensors. The future may hold even more medical and body-related sensors revealing many private details on their users.

but: its real devices anyway, data will never be perfect, experiments always have to cope with this anyway

Sensorium play store stats:
usage peak: 51 concurrent device installs August 2014
total installs: 475 as of august 2014
on various types of devices (including tablets)
across several countries (top: US, DE, AT, India, Turkey)
and all carriers
with not particular advertisement (demo presentation at one national conference)



There exist problems for the practical viability of collection data though: Different devices and platforms such as Android and iOS use very different interfaces into their sensors; privacy is another issue hardly tackled on any platform other than in a crude binary (allow/deny access) way. Therefore, in this demo we introduce Sensorium, a generic sensor reading framework that funnels data from actual sensor drivers, implements fine-grained privacy control for the user, and provides generic outbound interfaces such as \acrshort{XML}-\acrshort{RPC}. We also show an application using it, \gls{O3GM}, which visualizes mobile coverage data coming from Sensorium.

%Sensor interfaces differ -> difficult to do generic stuff with them
Sensorium can access all the information a device provides and makes them available to other applications. Up until now, it has been a challenging task for software developers (especially scientists and experimenters) to implement specialized sensor applications. This task is simplified by providing a generic framework for interfacing sensors. In our current implementation, available for Android, most of the typical sensors are already implemented. Since giving access to sensor data also exposes the user's privacy, the user can disable or set privacy levels for each sensor individually, and all sensor readings that would be shared are displayed. %Setting higher privacy levels reduces the amount of data a sensor shares. %E.g., location data accuracy could be rounded, or just hashes of data shared.
\\

\gls{O3GM}\footnote{\url{https://o3gm.cs.univie.ac.at/o3gm/}} showcases the sensors framework. It comprises a web service displaying cellular access technology data points at their \gls{GPS} locations collected by devices running Sensorium (see Figure~\ref{c5:fig:ogggm}). This solves a real-world problem: Currently, this kind of data is only available to mobile operators, which however  are hindered by commercial interests to make them publicly available --- at least in raw, unadorned form. Other projects such as OpenSignalMaps\footnote{\url{http://opensignal.com/}} and Sensorly\footnote{\url{http://www.sensorly.com/}}, as well as corporations like Google and Apple collect these data, but are very restrictive regarding usage by other parties. This is not true for \gls{O3GM}: We make the data points collected available as Open Data under an open content license.

Obviously, other applications are possible. Since code and data are open-sourced, everyone can implement their great ideas, port Sensorium to other platforms or reimplement our interface there, etc.

\caption{The \gls{O3GM} web page, displaying a \gls{3G} coverage measurements layer with data collected by Sensorium on top of the OpenStreetMap base layer.}
\label{c5:fig:ogggm}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Architecture}

Figure~\ref{c5:fig:architecture} overviews Sensorium's architecture components, and its interplay with the data collecting parts of \gls{O3GM}. \textit{Sensor drivers} are implemented on top of the operating system taking care of reading sensor values from platform-specific interfaces and pushing them upwards into the \textit{registry}. Here, sensor data is timestamped and collected. On one side, data are prepared for local display, e.g., in a \gls{GUI} or status widget. On the other side, a user-configurable \textit{privacy layer} might allow for full sensor access from above or reduce the precision of values (e.g., round \gls{GPS} coordinates); it could salt and hash sensor values for improved privacy, or completely deny access to individual (or all) sensors. Finally, other applications running on the same device are free to connect to Sensorium's \textit{outbound interfaces} to register for sensor updates or poll data. Access from sources other than localhost is not allowed for obvious privacy reasons.

Due to the layered architecture, it is very simple for contributors to add their own implementations of layers or swap them out for their own altogether. Consider a scenario when a contributor wishes to include a sensor we do not yet provide a driver for. All that needs to be implemented is code interfacing the actual sensor, and the lightweight \gls{API} into our sensor registry. Similarly, additional local display methods, privacy enhancements, and outbound interfaces might be implemented.

	\caption{Sensorium architecture with \gls{O3GM} \textit{pickup}~and \textit{server}. Previously existing components are marked with a dotted line.}
\label{c5:fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Implementation}

Our current implementation of Sensorium\footnote{\url{https://github.com/fmetzger/android-sensorium}} runs on the Android platform. To provide a unified interface for accessing the sensor data we incorporated an \acrshort{XML}-\acrshort{RPC} library\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/android-xmlrpc/}} that listens for connections on localhost, meaning that only applications running on the same device can access it. 
The pickup code to collect sensor values runs on top of the renowned Seattle\footnote{\url{https://seattle.poly.edu/html/}} platform, which is also available for Android, and allows us to remotely and securely access the collected data, and easily experiment with energy and cost efficient data upload/download strategies. 
The example application we implemented to make use of Sensorium, O3GM\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lukpueh/Open3GMap}}, is based on JavaScript and the OpenLayers\footnote{\url{http://openlayers.org/}} library. All of our code is dual-licensed under \gls{GPLv3} and the \acrshort{BSD} license.

\end{figure}

Sensorium consists of a base registry service with a common interface which each sensor implementation can easily be plugged into. All values are also displayed for the user as seen in Figure~\ref{c5:fig:sensorium}. The privacy layer automatically anonymizes all gathered values before making them available through XML-RPC in accordance with the user's current privacy settings.

We currently provide sensor implementations for generic device information, e.g. device name and battery status; mobile radio data such as current access technology and cell information; location data provided by the mobile network and \gls{GPS}; and  WiFi and Bluetooth information, including recent scan results.

Sensorium attempts to bring the sensing capabilities of current generation devices to a broader range of developers and experimenters. Directly using Sensorium, which is freely available from the Google Play store, or adopting the available source code gives everyone the chance to build projects like the mobile coverage Web service we presented.

\section{Survey of 3G/4G Evaluation and Simulation Frameworks}

While there are some active measurement studies specifically targeted at reliable streaming in mobile networks, e.g., \cite{Muller:2012:EDA:2151677.2151686}, most rely either on fixed networks or simulations.


Simulation frameworks are especially important for mobile networks, as acquiring packet-level traces and information about every node in an actual commercially operating cellular network is nigh impossible due to the users' privacy and the provider's business concerns.

Therefore, it would be very desirable to find an existing framework, that covers all important aspect in 3G or 4G mobile networks.

Most 3G/4G simulators only concern themselves with he physical radio link, completely neglect all other network paths, especially the core and all control plane signaling interactions.

Interestingly, the situation is even worse for \gls{UMTS} despite being significantly older.

The following list summarizes a number of simulators.

\begin{itemize}

	\item Radio system level UMTS for ns-2
\url{http://net.infocom.uniroma1.it/reti_files/reti_downloads.htm}
outdated, not up-to-date to newest standards

	\item \url{http://www.valid8.com/UMTS_Core_Network_Simulator.html} Not publicly available and commercial
also seems to focus on the circuit switched domain

	\item \url{http://seacorn.cs.ucy.ac.cy/eumtssim/}
\cite{vranjevs2011use}
Seacorn UMTS simulator (rather patches to ns-2), no public access
does not include any of the core network's protocols or procedures
but is also based on outdated specs and not actively maintained

	\item Only commercial: UMTS model in OPNET (now: Riverbed Modeler)
\url{http://www.riverbed.com/products/performance-management-control/network-performance-management/network-simulation.html}
again radio and user plane focused 

	\item Matlab-based radio link system-level sim
\url{http://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/research/mobile-communications/lte-simulators/}

	\item LTE-Sim
Simulating LTE Cellular Systems: An Open-Source Framework \cite{5634134}
\url{http://telematics.poliba.it/index.php/en/lte-sim}
simulates some nodes (UE, eNB, MME) and only a limited selection of involved protocols (PDCP, RLC, very basic RRC)
very limited for network/transport layer protocols (only basic ip, tcp not even implemented), rudimentary implementation not even close to reality

	\item Omnet++ \url{http://www.omnetpp.org/}
with SimuLTE framework https://github.com/inet-framework/simulte
only user plane (but also user plane core nodes SGW/PGW)
comparable level to ns-3

	\item ns-3
\gls{LTE}-\gls{EPC} Network Simulator (LENA)\cite{Baldo:2013:OSM:2507924.2507940} 
\url{http://networks.cttc.es/mobile-networks/software-tools/lena/}
\url{http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.20/doxygen/group__lte.html}
\url{http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.20/models/html/lte.html}
Most complete of all open source simulation approaches, but still only very rudimentary in the core and signaling
but combined with ns-3 offers almost complete representation of a vanilla network and transport level network stack
Can also use Network Simulation Cradle (NSC) \url{http://research.wand.net.nz/software/nsc.php}
to incorporate the actual Linux TCP/IP stack
however: only 2.6.26 (very old!)
and less instrumentation/logging available for this stack

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation/Emulation Hybrid}


Use introduced streaming evaluation approaches in a mobile network environment

But do not want to use real network, as conditions are hard to manage and reproduce.

comparable to the initial (simple) network emulation used in the measurement framework in Section~\ref{c3:measurements} using static values
here it acts as a dynamic network emulator, delaying packets based on its pass-through time through the network, while also adding packet loss.

Therefore, use an emulated network provided by the ns-3 network simulator. But transmit real traffic through it, i.e., use it as an emulator and bridges. \ref{c5:fig:streaming-simulation} \ref{c5:fig:streaming-hybrid}
