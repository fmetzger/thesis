Core is usually neglected in communication investigations


The Internet has reached ubiquity some time ago. When there is no wired access nearby you can rely on WiFi hotspots and cellular networks for wide area coverage. These cellular networks are usually based on \gls{3GPP} specifications which have evolved from the circuit switched \gls{GSM} network into the fully packet switched \gls{LTE} which is still in its unrolling phase. But being packet switched does not mean that it shares a lot of similarity with a typical wireline Internet protocol stack and network infrastructure. A ``3G'' network (a term synonymous for the typical type of cellular network used today) is very distinct from typical wired networks as it must provide, amongst others, mobility and authentication in its core specifications rather than being optional on-top services as is typically used in the Internet.

The TCP/IP stacks largely follows two principles: \gls{KISS} and the end-to-end principle\cite{saltzer1984end2end}, which essentially means to restrict the protocols to the necessary bare-minimum and keep state only in the end systems. 3G takes a different approach, keeps a large amount of state at the obligatory nodes in its ``core network'', which explicitly communicate by signaling procedures defined by the \gls{3GPP}.
The adverse effects of state-keeping in network devices have been known to, e.g.,  Internet users running BitTorrent across low-end home routers as of the early 2000s. In \gls{UMTS} mobile networks, the networking hardware is vastly more powerful, but the control plane tasks are vastly more complex than port and network translation as well, namely carrying and routing IP and voice traffic, user mobility, \gls{AAA} and so on. Many specialized protocols are involved to communicate intents and states in the network. This causes processing overhead, additional traffic on network paths, and increases the number of states to be held in memory on the core network nodes. All of these attributes can be subsumed under the term network ``load'' which we plan to investigate in this work.

While other publications look at the near-edge interactions in these network, research on the core is scarce, the reason for it being simple: you cannot do research without data from the operator there. Research at the edge, beginning at the IP stack level and upwards, can be conducted relatively simple. Writing simple tests and measurement scripts, often involving tcpdump and other tools, is usually all you need. But a mobile phone doesn't let you peek inside its layer 1 and 2 interactions (or even the implementation). Any information on this black box must be indirectly inferred from above (forcing behavior known from the specifications through scripts) or below (spectrum analysis using software defined radio approaches). To take a look at the core's view of traffic and data, one needs access to a dedicated measurement and capturing infrastructure placed inside the network. With this, researchers can not just look into user traffic flowing through the network but also quite easily into the signaling heavy mobile network control plane. 

Operators usually dimension their networks in relation to the occurring user traffic. But in such a signaling-dependent architecture this might not hold true anymore, as every user traffic has to be explicitly allowed, set up, and metered through all of the network's components. This has already led to some troubles in some mobile access networks, as heavy signaling for user traffic tunnels with very small amounts of traffic, that were however closed and reopened at a very high rate, caused an unintended \gls{DDoS} in the radio access network\cite{lt2012docostorm, it2011birdandroid}. 
This inherent complexity of signaling in mobile cellular networks is easily missed by programmers who do not or cannot know that their applications will run over such wireless links, and probably would not expect it from a network that pretends to transparently carry IP.

In this publication we attempt to give some insights into the mobile network control plane and its impact on dimensioning and load modeling. To do this, some important aspects of the \gls{3GPP} specifications have to be explained to give some basic vocabulary for the following exploratory research into signaling with a focus on \gls{PDP} Contexts and their management through \gls{GTP} tunnel management procedures. Using a week long data set from an Austrian mobile operator recorded at the Gn interface between the \gls{SGSN} and \gls{GGSN}, we attempt to find criteria influencing the signaling but we are also formulating hypotheses on the load impact of signaling, both backed by statistics gathered from the the data set.\\

%% CoNEXT Intro starts here

Given its roots as a research network and its growing pervasiveness over the last forty years, it is understandable that research on the Internet covers all parts of the network from applications to access to the core, and has been going on ever since what could be considered prehistoric times of the Net. The state of research on mobile cellular networks such as 3G is lean in comparison. Mobile networks providing Internet access have not been around for too long, and still are not available in all parts of the world. Furthermore, most research focuses on user-oriented metrics such as traffic statistics and mobility patterns, or takes into account the radio part of the network only. Little has been published about activity within the core network, and yet less about signaling.

Given how limited spectral resources on the radio interface are, it might not seem obvious to think about signaling load in the network. Yet, there have been situations where the core network unintentionally has been flooded with signaling, taking down user-plane connectivity on the way, despite small amounts of actual user traffic being transported \cite{lt2012docostorm, it2011birdandroid}. 

The adverse effects of state-keeping in network devices have been known to, e.g.,  Internet users running BitTorrent across low-end home routers as of the early 2000s. In \gls{UMTS} mobile networks, the networking hardware is vastly more powerful, but the control plane tasks are vastly more complex than port and network translation as well, namely carrying and routing IP and voice traffic, user mobility, \gls{AAA} and so on. Many specialized protocols are involved to communicate intents and states in the network. This causes processing overhead, additional traffic on network paths, and increases the number of states to be held in memory on the core network nodes. Therefore, in scenarios such as the ones mentioned above, radio access is not the bottleneck to connectivity any more, but signaling is.

The inherent complexity of signaling in mobile cellular networks is easily missed by programmers who do not or cannot know that their applications will run over such wireless links, and probably would not expect it from a network that pretends to transparently carry IP. What furthers this problem is the lack of literature on the theoretical and practical sides of these issues.

This apparent lack is due to a number of reasons. First, gaining sufficiently intimate knowledge on the huge corpus of \gls{3GPP} Technical Specifications %\gls{TS}
is a laborious task. Second, to come up with lower-layer measurements requires physical access to the core network infrastructure and suitable measurement equipment. Also, much of the data is commercially and privacy-sensitive, and cannot be published without extensive sanitizing.

The purpose of this paper will therefore be to give a 3G tunnel management primer, introducing the relevant \acrshort{GPRS}/\acrshort{UMTS} network structure and the involved control plane protocols with a special focus on the \gls{GTP}, which is probably the most prevalent. % We discuss how much overhead is put on the network through \gls{GTP} in a typical user traffic scenario.
Furthermore, we share our first insights into one practical aspect of the signaling process, the \gls{GTP} tunnel management procedures. Using a week long data set from an Austrian mobile operator recorded at the Gn interface between the \gls{SGSN} and \gls{GGSN}, % by the \gls{METAWIN} measurement infrastructure from the FTW, 
we take a look at \gls{PDP} Context durations, i.e. the time a \gls{PDP} Context is established and held, argue how this influences the load on the network, and evaluate the data by device types and operating systems.

Our measurement data backs up a number of straightforward assumptions on the behavior of different device and operating system types, but also reveals some remarkable differences in tunnel characteristics.\\

\section{A New Definition for Mobile Core Network Load}
\label{c4:loaddefinition}

Before beginning the evaluation, the primary question driving this investigation was: ``How can load in a core network be defined and measured?'' A summary of our thoughts to this question follows here.

With the basics of the architecture in mind, a top candidate for high load is the \gls{GGSN}. All traffic leaving or entering the packet switched domain must go through this element, and it is in control of the described GTP signaling procedures as well. Being an endpoint for the GTP tunnel makes it responsible to sort and encapsulate incoming traffic into the corresponding user tunnel. To accomplish this a lot of state has to be kept -- and processed when signaling occurs. Therefore, our working hypothesis is, that in order to determine load the \gls{GGSN} needs to be monitored closely and any traffic related to this node investigated for indications of the current load.

For our definition of the term ``load'' we differentiate between signaling load and overhead on the one hand and processing load and memory consumption on the other hand. Both are measures of load at specific nodes. While the former mostly has an impact on the actual network traffic, the latter can only be grasped inside the network element. With our data we can directly investigate the signaling traffic but indirect measures for the processing load and memory usage have to be found. In the rest of this section we evaluate the results of several approaches to both of these definitions of load.

While looking at the \gls{GGSN} may be the most obvious choice, it is by far not the only one. 
In addition to GTP tunnels the \gls{SGSN} has to handle \gls{RAB} and mobility management as well. However, it is assumed, that there are more regionally distributed \gls{SGSN} nodes present in a typical mobile network. This means that a single element would have to handle less mobile devices and therefore load. One has also to bear in mind that the \gls{SGSN} can be completely circumvented by setting up a direct tunnel between \gls{GGSN} and \gls{RNC}.

Apart from the two gateways directly inside the traffic path there are several other nodes essential to the control plane decision making, which may very well be also very load-sensitive. The \gls{HLR} for example is a central database storing all user related information which need to be retrieved any time a user needs to undergo initial authentication and authorization. Typically, the procedures the elements are involved in are fewer and they are also harder to investigate with the data available to us. Hence, it was decided to concentrate just on the case of the \gls{GGSN}.

\subsection{Load Influencing Factors}

Having described our understanding of core network load we can now move to discuss some of the factors that could influence the load, making them targets for our evaluation.

The first and arguably one of the most important factors are the mobile devices themselves. Specifically, this covers the behavior of the network layer 1 and 2 implementation (sometimes called ``'baseband'') as well as the \gls{OS} and the running applications. The OS and baseband decide when the device should establish a mobile data connection, how long the connection is held, or which mobile technology takes preference. Depending on the access technology, be it \acrshort{GPRS}, \acrshort{EDGE}, \acrshort{UMTS}, \acrshort{HSPA}, or \acrshort{HSPA+}, we can expect subtle differences through their specifications, e.g. in the timing of the radio transmission intervals, which could influence our investigation. 

Some specific tunnel duration properties could stem from the \gls{OS}'s IP and transport protocol implementation. For example, TCP timeouts might be configured to different default values causing mobile connections and tunnels to be held either shorter or longer. Also, mobile network firewalls have been found to interfere with transport and application layer timeout and keep-alive or heartbeat mechanisms on mobile devices \cite{sigcomm11middleboxes}.

The actual user-traffic patterns are generated by the applications running atop the OS. An example for how applications can influence network signaling is the aforementioned ``Angry Birds'' with its ad-retrieval strategy causing network traffic and possibly signaling in certain intervals. Since the application ecosystem for smartphones is extremely rich and ever growing we cannot pinpoint individual ones from our aggregate dataset.

An additional factor in the picture is the user and her or his behavioral patterns. They express themselves both in the traffic dynamics and in the mobility pattern, but they are rather difficult to distinguish in such a dataset given the large amount of data and the difficulty of correctly correlating tunnel management messages. We leave this as potential future work.

Easier to observe are the temporal effects of user behavior, which do not target individual users but the overall effects of a device's usage based on the time of day, the day of the week, or other time spans. In network user traffic analyses diurnal effects are typically very distinct with peak traffic some time during the day and the lowest traffic shortly after midnight. But these investigations are for user traffic only. We aim to find out, if the mobile network control plane shows similar patterns and can thusly be correlated to user traffic.

We also expect the mobile network and its protocol implementations to express themselves in the measurements. For example, the \gls{RRC} idle timer is typically in the range of 10 to 30 minutes, which could mean there will be a large number of tunnels with a duration in this range. Such choices are usually made either by the mobile network operator or the device manufacturer and can vary from one implementation to another. It is therefore quite difficult to give any hard numbers in advance, and one has to correlate such aspects with certain events in the results.

\section{Summary}
\label{c4:sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we take a look at the signaling behavior of devices in an operational \gls{3G} mobile network providing Internet access. Our focus does not lie on the wireless or user-oriented parts of the network, but on signaling in the core network. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to offer a core network perspective on signaling. We give a \gls{GPRS} and \gls{UMTS} network primer, and introduce \gls{GTP} tunnel management, explaining the causes and actions within the network. Our evaluation is based on a week long data set acquired in the core network of an Austrian mobile operator.

% We now go back to the case of Angry Birds which was much quoted for causing excessive radio signaling at one point in time. 
In our observation of core network signaling involving PDP Contexts and their management, we looked at the effect of device types and operating systems on the duration of GTP tunnels. We can conclude that the distribution of tunnel durations in our evaluated dataset is dominated by smartphones. This is contrary to the conventional idea that a larger volume of user plane traffic also leads to an increase of signaling. In our dataset, this would mean that 3G dongles would cause most signaling, which is definitely not the case. In this aspect, our findings support the stories of the casual game ``Angry Birds'' causing signaling storms in mobile networks by frequently downloading small ads, each small download resulting in disproportionate amounts of signaling load being generated. We conjecture from our results that measures taken to improve the radio interface control plane such as Fast Dormancy can have the converse effects in the core, as they could increase the tunnel churn.

All in all, our paper shows that operators can determine which type of device has the most influence on the current network infrastructure by looking at and comparing tunnel duration distributions. %Moreover, if a load situation occurs in the core network, the operator can decide which devices are the root cause and take appropriate measures. 
This investigations can also lead to better network planning that is more aware of the control plane by providing the necessary tools to identify probable causes for control plane activity. Lastly, we hope to raises some awareness with programmers about the potential unintended side effects their application traffic patterns can cause.

\subsection{Future Endeavors}

This paper serves as an introduction to the topic of the 3G core network control plane, and therefore provides only some initial insights into the actual signaling dynamics. Therefore, we would like to expand our evaluations, as there are several  angles not investigated so far that could prove worthwhile.

To get a grasp of the imposed load on the network as well as the involved network nodes, a calculation of the sizes of the tunneling messages was already hinted at. To improve on this naive attempt, actual numbers on the message sizes and involved \glspl{IE} could be recorded in future traces. Having correct signaling traffic volume data still does not reveal the processing load on core network elements. We plan to improve our methodology in this respect by taking at a look at how long it takes for the gateway nodes to process \gls{GTP} messages with respect to the current amount of user traffic and signaling. \gls{GTP} tunnels also cause a certain amount of overhead through additional headers and potential fragmentation of the user traffic, providing another investigation venue for the future (albeit more oriented towards user-plane IP traffic). 

Furthermore, besides the device-based classification, a differentiation based on the user traffic dynamics and correlation to signaling is planned. When looking closer at specific users, the mobility behavior also comes to mind. To investigate this, we intend to take a closer look at the occurring tunnel update messages as evidence, amongst others for mobility.

We also look forward to searching for multiple active tunnels per device. As discussed previously, the \textit{Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure} enables devices to establish up to ten additional tunnels attributed with a different, higher QoS level, if the network supports this. The additional load of managing and holding multiple tunnels plus the displacement of other, ``lower-quality'' traffic could prove to be an interesting investigation. Initial observations indicate that this feature is rarely used today by very few types of devices, but it will be of increased interest in the face of ongoing LTE/EPS deployments, whose specifications expand upon this secondary tunnel concept.

In this paper, we took a look at the signaling behavior of devices in an operational \gls{3G} mobile network providing Internet access. Our focus does not lie on the wireless or user-oriented parts of the network, but on signaling in the core network. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to offer an in-depth core network perspective on signaling. We gave a \gls{GPRS} and \gls{UMTS} network primer, and introduced \gls{GTP} tunnel management and evaluated a week long data set recorded in the core network of an Austrian mobile operator.

In our observation of core network signaling involving \gls{PDP} Contexts and their management, we looked at the effect of device types and operating systems on the duration of \gls{GTP} tunnels. We can conclude that the distribution of tunnel durations in our evaluated dataset is dominated by smartphones. This is contrary to the conventional idea that a larger volume of user plane traffic also leads to an increase of signaling. In our dataset, this would mean that 3G dongles would cause most signaling, which is definitely not the case. Our paper shows that operators can determine which type of device has the most influence on the current network infrastructure by looking at and comparing tunnel duration distributions.

For additional load investigations we also looked at the inter-arrival and processing time of tunnels and found further evidence of radio and diurnal effects influencing the core network. With this data in mind, an initial M/M/$\infty$ queue was created to model load occurring at the \gls{GGSN} with simple stationary analysis. This also serves a basis for future more detailed models.

We think that this investigation and load modeling can lead to better network planning: Being more aware of the control plane provides the necessary tools to identify probable causes for control plane activity. We would also like to expand our evaluations, as there are several angles not investigated so far that could prove worthwhile. This includes an examination of the exact number and size of signaling messages flowing through the core, a more detailed picture of the processing load these messages induce at the \gls{GGSN}, and an evolved model. Furthermore, a differential analysis of our data compared to a newer dataset (potentially including \gls{LTE} access) could really prove worthwhile.

%%% MMB2014 Conclusion Starts here
In this paper we investigated trade-offs when virtualizing components of the mobile core network.

To this end, we first discussed a novel approach to mobile core network load modeling based on the control plane load at the \gls{GGSN}. The M/G/$c_c$ loss model is based on the currently implemented state of the network architecture and can serve as a baseline reference to plan and dimension one's own mobile network accordingly, not just based on expected user traffic as traditionally. To improve scaling in the future, we proposed a completely new and virtualizable approach to a \gls{GGSN}'s makeup.

Then, we presented random variables to model load in a \gls{GGSN} based on measurement data from the network of a nation-wide mobile service provider and made them available for reuse by other researchers.

Finally, we evaluate the model using a queing simulation. We have shown, that the system's blocking probability is roughly equal to the single-server model but in addition achieves large efficiency gains, even with very simplistic provisioning conditions and very long boot times. The model also has the ability to very easily scale out one's infrastructure by simply adding more small servers, reducing operational overhead. This might even lead to a new GGSN-as-a-Service business models, removing the need to provide and operate large amounts of infrastructure for rare cases of peak load. 
In the future we would like to deepen our modeling efforts to provide more dimensioning options for a core network. Also, we want to further investigate the correlation of user traffic and signaling and take a look at the implications specific traffic types bring for the core network.
