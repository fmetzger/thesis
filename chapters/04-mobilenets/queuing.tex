\subsection{Little's Law}
``A proof for the queuing formula: L= $\lambda$W'' \cite{little1961proof}

With $L$  as the number of customers in a stable system, the arrival rate of new customers $\lambda$ and the average time $W$ of a customer in the system this universal law states:

\begin{equation}
L = \lambda W
\end{equation}

\subsection{Kendall's Notation}

Kendall's notation is a naming and classification convention for queuing systems first defined by Kendall in in 1953 \cite{kendall1953stochastic} and later extended on. In its simplest form it reads $A/S/s$ with $A$ denoting the arrival distribution, $S$ the service time, and s the number of servers. One extended notation $A/S/s-q$, the one we will use, additionally describes the queue length. With this, one can, e.g., easily distinguish between a queueing system ($q=\infty$) and a blocking or loss system ($q=0$). The most commonly used arrival processes and servie time distributions are summarized in Table~\ref{c2:tbl:kendalldistributions}.


\begin{table}[htbp]
	\caption{Typical abbreviation of processes in Kendall's notation.}
	\label{c2:tbl:kendalldistributions}
	\begin{tabu}{X[l]X[6]}
	\toprule
	\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Description} \\
	\midrule
	$M$ & Markovian, i.e. Poisson, arrival process or exponential service time distribution\\
	$D$ & Deterministic arrival process or service time distribution\\
	$G$ & General arrival process or service time distribution with no special assumptions\\
	$GI$ & General arrival process with independent arrivals; also called regenerative \\ 
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabu} 
\end{table}

The simplest queuing system is \textit{$M/M/1-\infty$}, which can also be described as a Markov chain and thus 

TODO: oder direkt $M/M/n-\infty$?

State probability, i.e. number of customers in the system
Blocking probability $p_B$ (for loss systems)


Following from Little's Theorem, the queue utilization $\rho$ is given as
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\gamma}
\end{equation}

with $\lambda$ Poisson arrival rate, $\gamma$ exponential service time parameter
