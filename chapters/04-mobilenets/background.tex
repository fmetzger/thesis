\subsection{Standards and Standards Bodies}

Point out the Standards organizations responsible for mobile networks and the differences to / conflicts with other areas, especially the Internet

Compare \gls{3GPP} \glspl{TS} with \gls{IETF} \glspl{RFC} in terms of accessibility, size, technical clarity and what this means for the market and implementors (scarce number, because no one really understands TSs, only now \gls{FOSS} implementations of \gls{GSM} (barely \gls{GPRS}))

Conclude, that this pretty much hinders and closes any competitive market and innovation (not by committee) by few major players

\gls{IETF}+\gls{ISOC}+\gls{IAB}+? on Internet site
\gls{ISO}+\gls{ETSI}+? old school standards by committee, closed standards
\gls{ITU}+\gls{3GPP}+? mobile standards
\gls{IEEE}
