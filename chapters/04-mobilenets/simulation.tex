\section{Load Model Queuing Simulation} 
\label{c4:simulation}

As discussed, the solvability of a non-stationary Erlang loss system is very limited. To better tackle this, a simulative approach can be taken. Depending on the level of detail, different types of simulations are available.

Here, a queuing simulation is used to ascertain the blocking probability and tunnel serving slot utilization from the model using the fitted distributions from the trace.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Queuing Simulation Implementation}

The queuing simulation is implemented on the basis of a \gls{DES}. Instead of reproducing continuous time, this simulation is a series of discrete events. Time is advanced only at these events. 

A queuing model can be easily represented in a \gls{DES}.  Each tunnel request arrival is a modeled as a discrete event. When such an event occurs, three processes are executed. The first process draws a random number from a \gls{PRNG} mapped to \gls{IAT} exponential distribution to schedule the next arrival event. Secondly, the serving units are checked for any free units. If one is found, it will now be occupied. Else, this arrival will be marked as rejected and the third action skipped. This third process now determines the length of the tunnel using another \gls{PRNG} adjusted to the serving time distribution to schedule the event in which the tunnel exits the system.

This model was implemented on the basis of version 3.0 of the \textit{SimPy}~\cite{simpy} package, which is a Python \gls{DES} framework that provides the basic event and scheduling infrastructure. On top of this a base \gls{GGSN} class was constructed, managing the arrival of tunnel events and the scheduling of the service ending events. Specific classes for the traditional (i.e. monolithic) and virtualized (called ``multiserver'' in the code) nodes respectively exist. The implementation is also publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/fmetzger/ggsn-simulation/}} as a reference.

\subsection{Description and Design of the Individual Experiments}

To match the measurement data the simulation time is set to be \SI{7}{\day} in all simulation scenarios. The initial \SI{60}{\minute} of each experiment are considered to be the transient phase and are afterwards deducted from the results. Ten replications of each scenario were performed. All depicted error bars show the \SI{5}{\percent} and \SI{95}{\percent} quantiles of all replications.

The first experiment was conducted to investigate the normalized baseline load a monolithic \gls{GGSN} experiences using the presented model. Using this, a maximum to the number of concurrent tunnels and the correlation to the blocking probability and tunnel rejection rate can be established. The effects of scaling up, improving the hardware capabilities of the single node, can thus be investigated.

Based on these results, the virtualization and scaling out effects in the virtualized, \gls{GGSN} model are examined. In order to study the feasibility of this approach the performance indicators of the virtual \gls{GGSN} are compared to the baseline established in the first experiment. To this end, the virtual \gls{GGSN} is simulated in configurations varying the number of instances and supported concurrent tunnels per instance.

In a final experiment the startup and shutdown duration of virtual instances and the life cycle management of these instances are additionally taken into account. Although the boot duration of modern \glspl{os} and \glspl{VM}, especially on current hardware with flash storage, is significantly lower than it has been in the past, there is still a delay. This could cause further blocking if the load balancer does not account for this. But the more generously the balancer starts instances in advance the smaller the virtualization efficiency gain, especially the energy consumption, will be become. For this reason, the number of active instance is a relevant performance metric in the virtual \gls{GGSN} model.

The experiment varies the boot delay and implements a very simple load balancer rule as baseline. The rule keeps at least one empty instance running in reserve at all times and deactivates instances, when two running instances are completely unused. As this is very generous, virtualization blocking should only occur in cases of very small instances or very rapid arrivals. Realistic provisioning rules can improve on this quite easily. But even this simplistic approach already serves to demonstrate potential benefits.

\subsubsection{GGSN Load, Capacity, and Scaling}

First, with the help of the \glspl{IAT} and duration of tunnels calculated in the dataset evaluation, the monolithic \gls{GGSN} model is studied. While these traces provided information on the frequency of new tunnels and the duration they remain active, no reliable information on the number of required supported concurrent tunnels for a given arrival rate could be deduced. 
This experiment evaluates arbitrary values for the \gls{GGSN} tunnel capacity and determines the resulting blocking probability such that a suitable value can be found. This is a typical task in a dimensioning process.

  \caption{Impact of the number of supported parallel tunnels on the blocking probability for the traditional \gls{GGSN} model. For each scenario the mean of all simulated replications as well as \SI{5}{\percent} and \SI{95}{\percent} quantiles as error bars are shown.}
\label{c4:fig:traditional_blocking}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{c4:fig:traditional_blocking} studies this impact of the maximum supported number of concurrent tunnels $n$ on the blocking probability $p_B$. $n$ is incrementally increased in steps of \numprint{100} tunnels from \numprint{0} to \numprint{5500}. As expected, the blocking probability decreases with the number of supported tunnels.An almost linear correlation can be observed in the larger part of the graph with a small convergence phase shortly before reaching $p_B=0$. For the normalized inter-arrival no blocking is occurring if a capacity of \numprint{5000} concurrent tunnels is allocated to the \gls{GGSN}. The results are stable across all simulation runs as the error bars display. For the purpose of network dimensioning the results can be easily scaled up from the normalized arrival rates to the actual ones in the network in question.

In order to analyze the influence of the different model parameters on the resulting metrics, a one-way \gls{ANOVA} is performed, with the results depicted in Table~\ref{c4:tab:manipulation2color}. High values for $\eta_p^2$ and Cohen's $f^2$ \cite{stats} indicate that the main influence for both blocking probability and mean number of tunnels is the maximum number of tunnels $n$ and servers $S_{\max}$, i.e. the total number of possible concurrent tunnels in the system.
Therefore, we study these parameters first.

 \label{c4:fig:instance_use_virtual}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{c4:fig:instance_use_virtual} the \gls{CDF} of the number of active servers for four different virtual \gls{GGSN} configurations is displayed. We observe, that increasing the number of supported tunnels per server allows a larger percentage of servers to be shutdown or used for other tasks. This demonstrates the scaling capability of the virtualized model quite well. Note, that both the scenario with \numprint{30} servers and \numprint{150} maximum tunnels per server as well as the scenario with \numprint{60} servers and \numprint{75} maximum tunnels per server share the same maximum amount of tunnels, \numprint{4500}, being right at the center of the interesting range of candidates.

\subsubsection{Virtualization Impact and Gain}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/blocking-comparison.pdf}
  \caption{Relative increase of blocking probability on the number of servers compared to the traditional \gls{GGSN}; with the $4500$ maximum tunnels per server being on a single server, $150$ on $30$, and $75$ on $60$ servers.}
 \label{c4:fig:blocking-comparison}
\end{figure}

Next, we take a look at the blocking probability of the virtual \gls{GGSN} system in Figure~\ref{c4:fig:blocking-comparison} and compare it to the results from the traditional \gls{GGSN} model. In Figure~\ref{c4:fig:blocking-comparison} we compare the blocking probability of the traditional \gls{GGSN} system dimensioned for $4500$ concurrent tunnels with the virtual \gls{GGSN}.

We observe that, with the start up and shut down time of $5$ minutes in mind, the blocking probability increases by a factor of $1.48$ if the capacity of each server is set to $75$, i.e. $\frac{1}{60}$ of the original server capacity, while $27$ of all $60$ servers can be turned of or used for other purposes at \SI{50}{\percent} of the time. We conclude, that choosing more powerful servers decreases the blocking probability but reduces the potential to disable servers.

So far we have considered a conservative start up and shut down time of servers of \SI{5}{\minute}, which can potentially occur if current generation physical servers are used.
In the next section we study the impact of reduced start up and shut down times with modern servers with fast storage (e.g. \glspl{SSD}) or virtual servers provisioned in the cloud.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Virtual Instance Life Cycle Management Impact}

In this section, we first consider the impact of different boot and shut down times on resource utilization and blocking probabilities. We observe the impact of different start up and shut down times on both resource utilization and blocking probability. Afterwards, the influence of varying server start and stop times on a fixed combination of maximum tunnels and servers in the system is examined.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/compare-util-block.pdf}
  \caption{Trade-off between blocking probability and mean resource utilization with regard to maximum number of servers, maximum number of tunnels per server, and start up and shut down time.}
 \label{c4:fig:compare_util_block}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{c4:fig:compare_util_block} shows scenarios with $40$ and $100$ number of virtual \gls{GGSN} instances and  $1000$ to $5000$ total concurrent tunnels. For each scenario, we study the impact of selecting different maximum numbers of tunnel per server as well as start up and shut down times on blocking probability and mean resource utilization. The first observation is that by increasing the number of servers, i.e. scaling out, the blocking probability can be decreased, while maintaining a relatively low mean resource utilization. In addition to the previous effects, we notice that a higher start up and shut down time causes a slight increase in blocking probability for servers with low tunnel capacity.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/compare-maxinstances-block.pdf}
  \caption{Influence of start up and shut down time on blocking probability with regard to different numbers of servers.}
 \label{c4:fig:compare_maxinstances_block}
\end{figure}

In order to study this behavior in more detail, we focus on a specific scenario in Figure~\ref{c4:fig:compare_maxinstances_block}, where $5000$ total tunnels should be supported by the system. In order to achieve this goal, we consider three types of instances, with the server capacity varying between $50$ and $500$.  In each case we change the start up and shut down time between $1$ and $5$ minutes. It can be easily observed, that lower server capacities combined with higher start up and shut down times increase the blocking probability. This is due to the server start up threshold mechanism, used in the model, not taking the additional capacity gained by activating an additional server into account. If a low capacity server with a long boot time is activated, there is a high probability that the system will quickly expend its capacity again.

Thus, it can be concluded, that if smaller instances are to be used, for example because they are cheaper than large instances, start up and shut down times should be kept minimal, for example by using virtual instances or \glspl{SSD}.
